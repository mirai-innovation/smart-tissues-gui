ABSTRACT
Artificial skins have been used as skin substitutes for wound healing in the clinic, and as in vitro 
models for safety assessment in cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. The three-dimensional 
(3D) bioprinting technique provides a promising strategy in the fabrication of artificial skins. 
Despite the technological advances, many challenges remain to be conquered, such as the 
complicated preparation conditions for bio-printed skin and the unavailability of stability and 
robustness of skin bioprinting. Here, we formulated a novel bio-ink composed of gelatin, sodium 
alginate and fibrinogen. By optimizing the ratio of components in the bio-ink, the design of the 
3D model and the printing conditions, a fibroblasts-containing dermal layer construct was firstly 
fabricated, on the top of which laminin and keratinocytes were sequentially placed. Through air- 
liquid interface (ALI) culture by virtue of sterile wire mesh, a full-thickness skin tissue was thus 
prepared. HE and immunofluorescence staining showed that the bio-printed skin was not only 
morphologically representative of the human skin, but also expressed the specific markers related 
to epidermal differentiation and stratum corneum formation. The presented easy and robust 
preparation of full-thickness skin constructs provides a powerful tool for the establishment of 
artificial skins, holding critical academic significance and application value.

1.Introduction
Skin is the largest organ of the human body and 
plays a vital role in protecting the human body 
from the external environment [1,2]. Since skin is the body’s first line of defense, it is vulnerable to 
various damages such as traumatic wounds, burns, 
and diabetic feet [3,4]. When the skin is severely 
damaged and fails to heal itself, the main

engineered skin replacements [5]. Due to the lim-
ited transplantable autologous skin, it is particu -
larly crucial to develop tissue-engineered skin 
substitutes for the treatment of skin damages 
[1,6]. In addition, European legislation has prohib -
ited the use of animals for testing cosmetic ingre -
dients, and meanwhile increased the number of 
industrial chemicals that must undergo risk assess -
ment [7,8]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for 
high-quality skin substitutes to replace animals for 
testing in the fields of cosmetics and 
pharmacology.
3D bioprinting is a state-of-the-art technology 
to fabricate biological constructs with hierarchical 
architecture similar to their native counterparts by 
precisely locating living cells, extracellular matrix 
(ECM) components and various signaling mole -
cules like growth factors in a layer-by-layer assem -
bly [9,10]. Developing living functional tissues by 
artificial means can address unmet needs in tissue 
replacement, organ transplantation, and sample 
testing [11–13 ]. Thus, the 3D bioprinting techni -
que provides a promising strategy in the fabrica -
tion of artificial skin or skin equivalents. Several 
researchers have devoted themselves to fabricating 
skin equivalents via 3D bioprinting. Vivian Lee 
et al. constructed a multi-layered cell and matrix 
structure to reproduce key morphological and bio-
logical features of in vivo human skin [14]; how -
ever, using collagen as the bio-ink resulted in poor 
printing accuracy. Prasad Admane et al. utilized 
the silk-gelatin bio-ink-based 3D bioprinting strat -
egy to recapitulate a number of design and biolo -
gical parameters akin to human skin [15], but the 
prepared skin failed to form a dense and thick 
epidermal layer. In addition, although Cubo 
N et al. used a fibrin-based bio-ink for the printing 
of primary human cells in form of sheets [16], the 
undulated pattern of the dermal-epidermal junc -
tion of the human skin was not demonstrated.
In this paper, we presented an approach that 
enables extrusion-based 3D bioprinting of a full- 
thickness human skin model in a simple, eco-
nomic and robust way. Firstly, the skin frame 
was printed with bio-ink containing fibroblasts. 
Then, the thus-obtained skin frame was covered 
with the 50 μg/ml laminin solution followed by 
seeding of epidermal cells. Lastly, the full-thickness skin tissue was fabricated through ALI culture via 
wire mesh (Scheme 1). According to our experi -
mental procedure, the printed full-thickness 
human skin will form a thicker epidermis and 
a distinct stratum corneum will be differentiated 
after 2 weeks of culture. Such a full-thickness 
human skin construct will prove to be highly 
applicable for drug or cosmetic testing in compar -
ison to conventional trans-well cultures and ani-
mal models.
2.Materials and methods
2.1 Cell culture and expansion[ 17]
Human fibroblasts were isolated from human 
foreskin specimens (12 years old) obtained during 
circumcision surgery performed at the 
Department of Urology of Anhui Provincial 
Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from 
the patient. The isolation method can be summar -
ized as follows: foreskin specimens were rinsed 
with PBS supplemented with 1% penicillin- 
streptomycin three times to remove the subcuta -
neous connective tissue and then spread in a flat 
dish. After the addition of Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%), 
the mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C to 
separate the epidermis and dermis. The dermis 
was cut into small pieces in a 35 mm petri dish, 
treated with 0.35% (w/v) Dispase II, and incubated 
for 60 min at 37°C. After being subjected to filtra -
tion and centrifugation, the primary fibroblasts 
were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco) supple -
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Lonsera) 
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at 37°C 
and 5% CO 2 before being used within passage 4– 
12. Epidermal cells (HaCAT, human immortalized 
epidermal keratinocyte cell line) were purchased 
from ATCC and maintained in the same medium 
as that for primary dermal cells.
2.2 Preparation of bio-link
Bio-ink used in this study was formulated as 
a mixture of 5% (w/v) gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich), 
1% alginate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 mg/ml fibrino -
gen (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, gelatin and alginate 
were dissolved at the required concentration in 
DMEM solution, and then stored for 1 hour at 10088
 J. LIU ET AL.60°C, followed by the addition of fibrinogen at the 
desired concentration. The thus-obtained mixture 
was then kept at 37°C. Fibroblasts were trypsinized 
and seeded in the bio-ink to obtain 2 × 106 cells/ 
ml in bio-ink, homogenized, and loaded in a sterile 
10 mL cartridge. After eliminating air bubbles, the 
cartridge was stored in the bio-printer for at least 
30 min at 10°C to make the ink printable.
2.3 3D model design
The digital 3D model was generated using 
BIOCAD software to simulate the dermal layer of 
human skin. The structure was designed with 
overall dimensions of 16 × 16 x 3 mm. The dermal 
layer consisted of a total of 10 layers. For the 
bottom 2 layers, the interfilament distance was 
kept at 0 mm to prevent cell suspension leakage. 
For the middle 4 layers and the top 4 layers, the 
interfilament distances were kept at 0.8 mm and 
1.6 mm, respectively.
2.4 3D Bioprinting of dermal layer constructs
Bio-printing was carried out using the 3D 
Discovery bioprinter (Regenhu, Switzerland). The 
barrel temperature was maintained at 10°C using 
a temperature controller and the printing chamber temperature was maintained at 20°C. The bio-ink 
was dispensed through a sterile metal needle (noz -
zle diameter 0.33 mm), using a pneumatic pressure 
of 1.8–2.5 Mpa and a deposition speed of 5 mm/s. 
The deposition speed and pressure were controlled 
by customized software developed by Regenhu. 
After the dermal layer constructs were printed, 
they were crosslinked by sterile 2% (w/v) CaCl 2. 
The crosslinked dermal constructs were washed 
with sterile saline solution thrice and dipped in 
DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicil -
lin-streptomycin) and incubated at 37°C and 5% 
CO 2 .
2.5 Preparation of full-thickness skin constructs
After dermal constructs were successfully obtained, 
each of the dermal constructs was covered with 
50 μg/ml laminin solution. Subsequently, epidermal 
cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, counted, and then 
evenly distributed on the prepared dermal con-
structs. Finally, the full-thickness skin models were 
transferred to sterile wire mesh for air-liquid inter -
face culture with the DMEM differentiation medium 
supplemented with Human Keratinocyte Growth 
Supplement (HKGS, ThermoFisher), 50 μg/ml 
ascorbic acid, and 1.3 mM CaCl 2 for 4, 7 and 
21 days, and then were harvested for further analysis.

 100892.6 Cell viability assay
Cell viability of the printed constructs was con-
ducted using Calcein-AM and PI on day 7. In the 
experiments, the working concentrations of PI and 
calcein-AM were 10 μg/ml and 5 μM, respectively 
[17]. The printed constructs were washed with 
PBS, incubated with the two dyes for 30 min at 
37°C and then visualized by a high-content analy -
sis system (CQ1, YOKOGAWA). In these assays, 
cells stained green/red were live/dead.
2.7 Histological analysis[ 17]
Full-thickness skins were collected after 7, 14, and 
21 days, washed immediately with phosphate-buf -
fered saline, fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 4°C for 
24 hr, and finally dehydrated in 70% ethanol. 
Thereafter, the samples were embedded in paraf -
fin, sectioned serially, and stained with hematox -
ylin and eosin kit (Sangon, China).
2.8 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
IHC was carried out to evaluate epidermal dif-
ferentiation in the 3D bio-printed constructs 
using anti-loricrin antibody (Abcam, dilution 
1:200,) and anti-cytokeratin 5 antibody (Abcam, 
dilution1:200) referring to the previous protocol 
[18]. Briefly, paraffin-embedded samples were 
cut into 7 μm sections. After dewaxing and 
rehydration, samples were incubated overnight 
with the primary antibodies at 4°C. Following 
this, secondary Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa 
Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit 
antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at 
room temperature. Nuclear counterstaining 
using DAPI (Sangon Biotech, China) was carried 
out routinely. Images were acquired using CQ1 
(YOKOGAWA, Tokyo) high-content 
microscope.
2.9 Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean ± standard 
deviation (SD) and subjected to one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison tests with n as the number 
of different experiments.
3.Results
3.1 Formulation of bio-ink
In the skin 3D bioprinting process, the selection 
of bio-ink is of great importance in forming 
a stable skin construct. To prepare the bio-ink 
suitable for the extrusion-based bioprinting of 
skin tissue, we tested diverse combinations of 
biomaterials. Eventually, the bio-ink used in 
this particular study was optimized based on 
commonly used alginate/gelatin ink [19]. 
Huayu Yang et al. have tested the bio-ink with 
various proportions of gelatin and alginate, and 
found that gelatin at low concentrations (3% and 
5%) in the bio-ink did not demonstrate 
a significant difference in cell viability, whereas 
cell viability decreased when the bio-ink con-
tained 7% gelatin [20]. In view of this, and 
taking into account the structural formation, 
cell viability, as well as cell proliferation in pro-
longed culture, we first tested multiple combina -
tions of gelatin and alginate in varying 
proportions, and ultimately used 5% gelatin 
and 1% alginate as a major component of bio- 
ink.
In addition, considering that fibrinogen is rich 
in several cell-binding sequences (such as Arg- 
Gly-Asp (RGD)) which are in favor of cell adhe -
sion, proliferation, and differentiation [21,22], 
we optimized the bio-ink by adding fibrinogen 
as a component. To verify the performance of 
the bio-ink, we compared the cell morphology in 
bio-inks with and without fibrinogen. The 
results showed that after being cultured for 
24 h, dermal cells were spindle-shaped in bio- 
ink with fibrinogen, whereas almost no spindle- 
shaped cells were observed in the bio-ink with -
out fibrinogen (Figure 1Eand f). By comparison, 
no significant difference occurred to epidermal 
cells in the two bio-inks, which might be related 
to the morphology of the epidermal cells 
(Figure 1band c). In a word, the results revealed 
that bio-ink containing fibrinogen was more 
conducive to cell adhesion compared to the 10090
 J. LIU ET AL.one without fibrinogen. In light of such results, 
the bio-ink consisting of 5% (w/v) gelatin, 1% 
alginate, and 2 mg/ml fibrinogen was chosen for 
subsequent bioprinting experiments.
3.2 Optimization of printing conditions
To apply bio-printed cellular constructs for skin 
tissue fabrication, it is imperative to guarantee the 
long-term survival and maintenance of functional 
cells encapsulated in the bio-ink [23]. 
Correspondingly, to arrive at optimal cell viability, 
we optimized conditions for skin 3D bioprinting 
by testing nozzles of different diameters to observe whether they pose a critical influence on the sur-
vival rate of the cells in the skin constructs. 
Specifically, we tested multiple nozzles the dia-
meter of which was 0.33 mm, 0.41 mm and 
0.51 mm, respectively, during the extrusion print -
ing. After printing the cell-laden bio-ink with these 
different nozzles, the live/dead assay was car-
ried out.
Figure 2 illustrated representative images for 
printed cellular constructs and the fluorescent 
images (live/dead, calcein-AM/PI) of the 
embedded cells within the bio-ink on day 7. On 
the one hand, it is obvious that, as the nozzle 
diameter increases, the printing accuracy

 10091decreases, with the 0.33 mm nozzle rendering the 
most elaborate construct (Figure 2a-c). On the 
other hand, as shown in Figure 2d-f, predominant 
green fluorescence evidenced the population of 
live cells and indicated that under conditions of 
0.33 mm, 0.41 mm and 0.51 mm nozzles, even 
on day 7 after printing, the viabilities of cells 
embedded in the bio-ink were significantly high 
(~95%, 93% and 86% respectively). That is, the 
0.33 mm nozzle can effectively improve printing 
accuracy without compromising cell survival. 
Based on the results, we selected the nozzle of 
0.33 mm in diameter for fibroblasts-laden struc -
ture printing in the current study.
3.3 Generation of full-thickness skin constructs
The schematic diagram shown in Scheme 1 illus-
trates the preparation steps to obtain the full- 
thickness human skin. A four-step strategy was 
implemented: fabrication of dermal skin con-
structs, coating with laminin, seeding of keratino -
cytes and ALI culture via sterile wire mesh.In the fabrication of dermal skin constructs, 
apart from the optimization of bio-ink and print -
ing conditions, the elaborate design of the 3D skin 
model is equally of paramount importance. In this 
present study, as described in Materials and 
Methods, we devised a dermal skin model of 10 
layers, wherein the initial 2 layers, the middle 4 
layers and the top 4 layers were designed with 
interfilament distances of 0 mm, 0.8 mm and 
1.6 mm, respectively. By doing so, on completion 
of the printing program, a groove-like pattern 
could be generated to accommodate the epidermal 
layers to be seeded for mimicking dermal- 
epidermal junctions of the human skin 
(Figure 3a-c).
As clearly demonstrated in Figure 3d-f, the 
printed dermal skin constructs matched well 
with the designed 3D model. After being gelled 
by 2% CaCl 2, the printed dermal skin construct 
possessed a certain elasticity and toughness and 
thus can be readily taken out and transferred 
(Figure 3h). On top of this, in an effort to 
further enhance the junctions of the dermis 
and epidermis, laminin solution was plated on

 J. LIU ET AL.the bio-printed construct before the epidermal 
cells were seeded. Following this, as shown in 
Figure 3i, we used sterile wire mesh instead of 
Transwell here for the ALI culture of the full- 
thickness skin. Based on all the above steps, 
a full-thickness skin construct was thus 
generated.
3.4 Histological evaluation of full-thickness skin 
constructs
To assess the structural components of the fab-
ricated full-thickness skin, histological analysis 
was performed. Figure 4 shows H&E staining 
of the full-thickness skin harvested after 7, 14, 
and 21 days of ALI culture, with a normal 
human skin serving as a control. As seen from 
the histological characterization, the printed skin 
was morphologically representative of the nor-
mal human skin. Specifically, in the printed full- 
thickness skin, the cells of the epidermal layer, 
when viewed from the bottom up, were more 
and more closely arranged and gradually flat-
tened with the increase of culture duration, indi-
cating a tendency to form cuticles. Apparently, 
the printed skin was capable of producing 
a dense, well-organized, and terminally differen -
tiated epidermis.3.5 Immunohistochemical evaluation of 
full-thickness skin constructs
As is well-known, correct stratification and locali -
zation of biomarkers of epidermal differentiation 
of the skin construct are crucial indicators for 
normal epidermal behavior [24]. Therefore, we 
further compared the full-thickness skin con-
structs with normal human skin in terms of bio-
markers using immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemical characterization shown 
in Figure 5 exhibited that the epidermis of printed 
skin was not only morphologically similar to that 
of the human skin but also expressed the specific 
maker related to epidermal differentiation and 
proliferation, such as cytokeratin 5 (Figure 5a). 
In addition, the skin barrier function, known to 
be closely related to the formation of the stratum 
corneum, was presented in the printed skin, pri-
marily owing to the presence of a fully differen -
tiated epidermis demonstrated by the expression 
of the specific maker loricrin (Figure 5b). 
Nevertheless, it can be found that the stratum 
corneum in the printed full-thickness skin was 
thinner than that in the normal human skin. In 
conclusion, these results suggested the formation 
of a well-differentiated but thin epidermis.

4.Discussion
Emerging as an advanced and promising techni -
que evolved from conventional 3D printing, 3D bioprinting possesses the considerable potential 
to create highly mimicked tissue or organs with 
a high degree of repeatability and flexibility [25]. 
Over the past decade, 3D bioprinting has been 
extensively employed in fabricating biological tis-
sues in various fields including bone, heart, carti -
lage, blood vessels, muscle, liver and skin, among 
others [12,26]. In terms of artificial skin or skin 
equivalents, in contrast to conventional skin tissue 
engineering methods [27,28], 3D bioprinting 
Figure 5. Immunohistochemical evaluation of full-thick skin constructs.10094
 J. LIU ET AL.offers the potential to recapitulate the macroscale 
architectures and micro-features of the natural 
skin and enables the rapid and reliable production 
of biomimetic cellular skin substitutes owing to 
their unique ability to precisely pattern living 
cells in pre-defined spatial locations [24,29].
Typically, the 3D bioprinting process of human 
skin tissue can be summarized as the following 
three steps: 1) cell selection and cultivation, bio- 
ink selection and preparation, and 3D model 
design of skin; 2) the actual printing process and 
maturation of the printed skin constructs; and 3) 
histological evaluation and biochemical character -
ization of the printed skin tissue [30]. At present, 
extrusion-based bioprinting, inkjet bioprinting, 
and laser-assisted bioprinting are the most com -
monly used bioprinting techniques for the fabrica -
tion of skin tissue [24,29]. Here, we fabricated 
a full-thickness human skin model with success 
by using extrusion-based bioprinting as per the 
general process.
Bio-inks, as one of the most essential elements 
for successful 3D bioprinting, provide structural, 
mechanical and biological cues for the cells 
embedded therein, and thus ought to possess out-
standing biological, rheological, and mechanical 
properties including excellent cell biocompatibil -
ity, high printing fidelity, favorable biodegradabil -
ity and high mechanical strength [25]. Currently, 
a variety of hydrogel materials (such as collagen, 
gelatin, fibrin, chitosan and hyaluronic acid and/or 
combinations thereof) have been used as bio-inks 
in bioprinting skin tissues [31]. In this work, based 
on these previous reports and in consideration of 
the desirable properties, a brand-new bio-ink that 
contains 5% (w/v) gelatin, 1% alginate, and 2 mg/ 
ml fibrinogen was selected through a great number 
of tests. Such a bio-ink brought about high cell 
viability and availed cell adhesion. Despite the 
superb performance of our bio-ink, bio-inks need 
to be further optimized with respect to biocompat -
ibility and mechanical strength in future work. In 
this regard, the ColMa (methacrylated collagen)- 
based bio-ink is supposed to be an excellent 
choice.
It is generally recognized that during extrusion 
printing, shear stresses applied to the bio-ink 
through a fine diameter nozzle can potentially 
damage cells [23,32]. Typically, the finer the nozzle, the greater the shear pressure. However, 
in our study, inconsistent with the expectation, the 
highest shear pressure induced by using the finest 
0.33 mm nozzle failed to pose the most harmful 
impact on the encapsulated cells. Moreover, it is 
conjectured that in the case of the 0.51 mm nozzle, 
the appearance of slightly more dead cells in the 
middle of interfilament could be attributed to the 
insufficient nutrient and waste diffusion.
In addition to cell and bio-ink selections, 3D 
model design of skin is crucial prior to the actual 
3D printing process [23,29,32]. In this connection, 
our groove-like pattern resulted from the inge -
nious design of the dermal skin model with differ -
ent layers having different interfilament distances 
indeed does favor to the tight dermal-epidermal 
junctions in the later culture. Besides, it is also 
worth mentioning here that the sterile wire mesh 
used in the ALI culture of the full-thickness skin is 
pretty economic, easily available, compatible with 
any size dish and can be added with a medium of 
desired volume to prevent nutrient and oxygen 
deficiency, thereby enormously saving the cost 
and simplifying the operation.
Histological evaluation of the printed skin con-
firmed the formation of a well-developed epider -
mis within the construct; however, a subtle 
difference in the thickness of epidermal layer defi-
nitely occurred between the printed skin and nor-
mal human skin. In accordance with the 
histological analysis, the positive expression of 
critical biomarkers (cytokeratin 5 and loricrin) 
tightly associated with epidermal differentiation 
and stratum corneum formation shown in immu -
nohistochemical detection indicated the presence 
of a fully differentiated but thin epidermis. We 
speculate that such a thin epidermal layer in our 
printed skin is most likely caused by the fact that 
during the post-printing culture, non-optical cul-
ture conditions were utilized. In the follow-up 
work, we will cultivate the printed skin construct 
under optical culture conditions. Plus, we will 
optimize the cytokines mix to promote the forma -
tion of full-thickness skin mimicking human skin. 
Moreover, fewer cell types, less extracellular 
matrix and less cell density in our fabricated full- 
thickness skin relative to the authentic human 
skin are all the possible causes of the thin epider -
mis, and thus need to be improved. In the future BIOENGINEERED
 10095study, the epidermal thickness could be also 
improved by means of prolonging the culture 
duration and optimizing the medium 
components.
Taken together, in spite of the successful bio-
printing of full-thickness human skin tissues, to 
recapitulate deeper complexity of native human 
skin, further optimization is required, including 
incorporation of other skin-related cell types such 
as melanocytes, endothelial cells, adipocytes, 
Langerhans cells, hair follicles, sweat glands and 
stem cells; development of novel bio-inks with 
better performance; and improvement of bioprint -
ing conditions such as the concentration of bio- 
ink, temperature of the nozzle and forming space.
5.Conclusions
In this study, we first fabricated dermal skin con-
structs through extrusion-based bio-printing. High 
cell viability within the printed constructs was 
maintained for at least 7 days after printing. The 
incorporation of laminin solution and the seeding 
of epidermal cells followed by ALI culture enabled 
the fabrication of full-thickness skin. Furthermore, 
the histological evaluation and immunochemical 
analysis revealed that the full-thickness skin pre-
sented here closely resembled native human skin, 
both morphologically and biologically. In 
a nutshell, this study provides a simple, robust 
and cost-saving fabrication of full-thickness skin 
constructs, which can be applied for drug screen -
ing, cosmetic testing and clinical treatment.

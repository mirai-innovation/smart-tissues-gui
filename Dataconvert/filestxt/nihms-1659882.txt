Abstract
Vascularizing printed tissues is a critical challenge in bioprinting. While protein-based hydrogel 
bioinks have been successfully used to bioprint microvasculature, their compositions are ill-
defined and subject to batch variation. Few studies have focused on engineering proangiogenic 
bioinks with defined properties to direct endogenous microvascular network formation after 
printing. Here, a peptide-functionalized alginate hydrogel bioink with defined mechanical, 
rheological, and biochemical properties is developed for direct bioprinting of microvascularized 
tissues. An integrin-binding peptide (RGD) and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-
mimetic peptide with a protease-sensitive linker (MMPQK) are conjugated onto biodegradable 
alginate to synergistically promote vascular morphogenesis and capillary-scale endothelial tube 
formation. Partial ionic crosslinking before printing converts the otherwise unprintable hydrogel 
into a viscoelastic bioink with excellent printability and cytocompatibility. We use the bioink to 
fabricate a compartmentalized vascularized tissue construct, wherein we observe pericyte-
endothelial cell colocalization and angiogenic sprouting across a tissue interface, accompanied by 
deposition of fibronectin and collagen in vascular and tissue components, respectively. This study 
provides a tunable and translational “off-the-shelf” hydrogel bioink with defined composition for 
vascularized bioprinting.

INTRODUCTION
Three-dimensional bioprinting provides a powerful platform to fabricate prevascularized 
tissues and organs.1–4 Microvessels, such as arterioles, venules, and capillaries, primarily 
regulate local blood-tissue nutrient exchange5 and play an essential role in supporting the 
viability of bioprinted constructs.6 Printable biomaterials, or bioinks, are the “raw materials” 
of bioprinting and have been used to print microvascular networks through direct and 
indirect approaches. Significant progress has been made in the past decade to develop 
sacrificial biomaterials and printing techniques for indirectly patterning vascular networks 
within bioprinted constructs.7–9 However, networks made by indirect methods are often 
>100 microns in diameter, making the approach less suitable for printing complex capillary 
networks that range from 3 to 10 μm in diameter.10 Furthermore, the post-printing process 
associated with removing fugitive materials and endothelializing the hollow networks is 
complex and time-consuming.10–13 Direct bioprinting provides a powerful alternative 
approach to fabricating microvasculature whereby cell-instructive bioinks are used to 
promote endogenous self-assembly of endothelial cells into capillary networks.10 However, 
this approach is currently limited by the low availability of bioinks tailored to promote 
vasculogenesis while satisfying rheological and printability criteria.11, 13
Hydrogels are excellent bioink candidates as they can mimic the biophysical and 
biochemical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM).14–17 Naturally derived hydrogels 
such as fibrin18, collagen19, gelatin20, 21, and decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)22 
have been widely used for vascularized bioprinting due to their innate bioactivity. However, 
the complex matrix characteristics of protein-derived biomaterials complicates fine-tuning of 
their proangiogenic properties and makes their compositions subject to batch variation.
13, 15, 23–26 Alternatively, synthetic and semisynthetic hydrogels can be chemically modified 
with bioactive sites like ECM-mimetic peptides, immobilized signaling peptides, and 
protease-sensitive crosslinkers for defined control over material properties and 
microengineering of cell-material interactions.27–30 Alginate, a naturally derived Barrs et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptpolysaccharide, is a popular synthetic ECM-mimetic biomaterial used in bioink formulations 
due to its biocompatibility, low cost, and rapid gelation kinetics.31, 32 Native alginate is 
bioinert, but can be modified with cell-adhesive peptides to tailor its bioactivity with 
excellent precision and control.33 Furthermore, the biodegradability of alginates can be 
controlled through partial oxidation of uronic acids in the polymer chain.34 Various other 
physical and chemical modifications can be made to fine-tune the chemical and physical 
properties of alginate hydrogels.35 These features make alginate an ideal canvas material for 
developing chemically defined bioinks with requisite printability and cytocompatibility.
Here, we developed an alginate-based hydrogel bioink for the direct fabrication of 
microvascularized tissue constructs (Figure 1). To promote vascular morphogenesis, the 
alginate was modified with RGD, an integrin-binding peptide for cell adhesion, and a 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mimetic peptide with a matrix metalloproteinase-
cleavable linker (MMPQK) for on-demand sequestration by migratory cells. In a coculture 
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human adipose derived stem cells 
(hADSCs), the alginates functionalized with both RGD and MMPQK significantly enhanced 
vascular morphogenesis at day 7 compared to hydrogels with RGD or MMPQK alone. 
Importantly, removing soluble VEGF from the culture media did not have a significant effect 
on the observed vascular morphogenesis in RGD+MMPQK hydrogels, verifying the VEGF-
mimetic nature of the MMPQK peptide. Remarkably, lumenized capillary-like networks 
formed after 14 days of culture without laminar flow. To convert the alginates into a 
printable bioink, a partial ionic crosslinking approach was employed, and the rheological 
and printability properties of the partially crosslinked hydrogels were evaluated. As a proof-
of-concept, the bioink was applied to fabricate a compartmentalized vascularized tissue unit 
(VTU), which contained a vascular component (bioink with HUVECs and hADSCs) 
surrounding avascular tissue components (bioink with human dermal fibroblasts).
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Materials.
Sodium alginate was purchased from FMC BioPolymer (Philadelphia, PA). Amino acids and 
resins were purchased from Protein Technologies, Inc. (Tucson, AZ). Ethylene glycol was 
purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hamtpon, NH). Hexafluorophosphate Benzotriazole 
Tetramethyl Uronium (HBTU) was purchased from Oakwood Chemical (Estill, SC). All 
other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless stated 
otherwise.
Oxidized alginate preparation.
Oxidized alginate was prepared as described by Bouhadir and others.34 One gram of sodium 
alginate powder was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled, deionized water. Sodium periodate 
was added at room temperature to achieve a theoretical oxidation of 1% of uronic acid units. 
The solution was stirred in the dark for 24 hours before being terminated with addition of 
ethylene glycol. Sodium chloride (3g) was then dissolved in the solution. Oxidized alginate 
was precipitated with addition of excess ethyl alcohol and centrifuged into a pellet. The Barrs et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptsupernatant was discarded, and the precipitation was repeated. The oxidized alginate pellets 
were frozen at −80°C overnight then lyophilized and stored at −20°C until use.
Peptide synthesis and conjugation to oxidized alginate.
Alkynyl-modified RGD peptides (Alkynyl-modified G 4RGDSP, M.W. = 895.89 kDa, 
MOLDI-TOF = 896.33 kDa) and Alkynyl-modified MMPQK peptides (Alkynyl-modified 
GPQGIAGKLTWQELYQLKYKGI, M.W. = 2628.04 kDa, half peak = 1315.00 kDa) were 
synthesized through solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), purified through flash column, 
and synthesis verified through liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on a 
Thermo Fisher LCQ Fleet Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer. Later, the peptides were covalently 
conjugated to oxidized alginate using orthogonal “click” chemistry. The degree of peptide 
functionalization was examined by 1H-NMR on Bruker A V500-III spectrometers. The 
characteristic peak of the proton on alginate backbone and the proton on the triazole were 
compared to determine the degree of peptide conjugation. Peptide conjugation to alginate at 
0.135 mmol/g (peptide/alginate powder) for RGDSP and 0.148 mmol/g (peptide/alginate 
powder) for MMPQK were utilized for the rest of the experiments unless otherwise stated.
Preparation of alkynyl-functionalized peptides.
The peptides were prepared SPPS conducted using the standard procedure described in the 
Novabiochem peptide synthesis manual. N-terminal unmodified peptides were cleaved from 
resin right after the deprotection once reaching the designed sequences. Alkynyl 
functionalization of peptides was carried out similarly to Zhang and Killian 36. Briefly, the 
mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) (0.3 mmol), N-
hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (0.3 mmol) and 4-Oxo-4-(2-propynyloxy)butanoic acid (Matrix 
Scientific, Columbia, SC) (0.3 mmol dissolved in DMF) was used to form the active NHS 
ester to react with the terminal amine group of the peptide chain (0.1 mmol) before they 
were cleaved from the resin. All the peptides were purified by flash column and 
characterized by LC-MS.
Preparation of azide-functionalized alginate.
198 mg of oxidized alginate was dissolved in 50 mL DI water. The mixture of EDC (19.2 
mg), NHS (11.5 mg) and 11-Azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine (21.8 mg) was added into 
the alginate solution and the reaction was performed for 24 hours. After that, the alginate 
was purified through ethanol precipitation. The alginate powder was obtained through 
lyophilization for later usage.
Conjugation of alkynyl-functionalized peptides onto alginate.
Copper(I)-assisted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) “click” chemistry was conducted as 
follows. 198 mg of azide-functionalized alginate was dissolved in 50 mL DI water. The 
mixture of CuSO 4 (16 mg), ascorbic acid (88 mg), Tris(3-
hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine (THPTA) (265 mg) and peptides (0.1 mmol) was 
added into the alginate solution and the reaction was performed for 24 hours. After that, the 
alginate was purified through ethanol precipitation and alginate powder was obtained 
through lyophilization for later usage.Barrs et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptHydrogel preparation and SEM analysis.
Functionalized alginate hydrogels were prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
imaging through freeze drying, as described previously.37 Briefly, 60 μL of peptide-
functionalized, 2% (w/v) alginate solution was pipetted onto 100 mM Ca2+-containing 
gelatin substrates in a 24-well plate for crosslinking overnight at 4 °C. The calcium-gelatin 
substrate was then melted in a 37 °C incubator for 15 minutes before being aspirated, and 
the hydrogels were then frozen at −20 °C for 3 hours, followed by −80 °C for 24 hours, and 
then lyophilized for at least 24 hours. The freeze-dried hydrogels were then gold sputter-
coated at 20 milliamps for 20 seconds (Denton Vacuum Desk V) and microstructures were 
observed in a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-3700N). SEM images at 200x 
magnification were analyzed using ImageJ software38 with the DiameterJ plugin39. The 
percentage of porosity of the hydrogels was quantified from three independent regions of 
interest in each of three individual hydrogels. First, the images were binarized using a 
statistical region-merging algorithm40, then the percentage of porosity was calculated from 
the areas of black (pores) and white (scaffold) pixels within the binary images.
Cell culture.
RFP expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (RFP-HUVECs) (Angio-Proteomie, 
Boston, MA) were maintained in complete Endothelial Cell Growth Medium 2 (EGM-2) 
(PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) with 10% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% 
Penicillin-Streptomycin. hADSCs (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) were maintained in complete 
ADSC Growth Medium (ADSCGM) (Lonza) with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% gentamicin 
sulfate. GFP expressing adult human dermal fibroblasts (GFP-hDFs) (Angio-Proteomie) 
were maintained in complete Fibroblast Growth Medium 2 (FGM-2) (PromoCell) with 2% 
FBS. All cells used were between passages 3–6.
Hydrogel cell behavior studies and image analysis.
Oxidized alginates functionalized with either RGD only, MMPQK only, or both RGD and 
MMPQK were dissolved in culture medium (2:1 EGM-2:ADSCGM) at a concentration of 
2% (w/v) alginate. Peptide concentration was 5% (w/w) of the alginate for each peptide. 
RFP-HUVECs were either suspended alone or with hADSCs at a 2:1 ratio for a total cell 
density of 5 million cells/mL in each alginate solution. Alginate solutions were pipetted as 
hydrogel “dots” into the wells of a 96-well plate containing calcium-gelatin substrate for 30 
minutes to allow for complete gelation. The plate was then placed in the incubator for 15 
minutes to melt the gelatin substrate. The melted substrate was aspirated, the hydrogel was 
rinsed with PBS, and fresh medium was added to the wells before returning the plate to the 
incubator. Media was changed every 2–3 days until the hydrogels were taken for imaging. 
For imaging, the hydrogels were placed onto glass slides in PBS to stay hydrated and RFP-
HUVEC morphology was analyzed using a Leica TCS SP5 Confocal microscope or a Zeiss 
Axiovert A1 Inverted Microscope and Zen 2011 software (Zeiss). Three hydrogel replicates 
per group were imaged at random and processed with AngioTool41 as described in their 
online manual to quantify vessel percentage area, average vessel length, and junction 
density. For analyzing invasion depth in the Vascularized Tissue Unit after 7 days, sprouting 
microvascular networks at the tissue bud interface were imaged using confocal microscopy. Barrs et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptA Zeiss Axiovert A1 Inverted Microscope and Zen 2011 software (Zeiss) was used to image 
vascular invasion at Day 14. The lengths of at least 3 sprouting networks were measured in 3 
separate VTUs at Day 7 or 14 using ImageJ. For CD31 and NG2 cell imaging, structures 
were fixed and stained with anti-CD31 (BD Pharmingen, 550389) and anti-NG2 antibody 
(Abcam, ab129051) following the manufacturer’s protocol and imaged via confocal 
microscopy. For ECM staining, the samples were fixed and stained with anti-fibronectin 
(Abcam, ab45688) or anti-collagen I antibody (Abcam, ab34710) following the 
manufacture’s protocol and imaged via confocal microscopy. The relative quantities of 
secreted fibronectin and collagen were quantified and compared by measuring background-
subtracted integrated density (n≥4) in the vascular and tissue components, respectively.
Partial crosslinking of alginate.
To prepare partially crosslinked alginates, stock solutions of calcium chloride dihydrate 
dissolved in water were prepared at concentrations of 0, 5, 10, and 20, and 30 mM. The 
stock solutions were slowly added to a 4% (w/v) alginate solution at a volume ratio of 1:1, 
yielding 2% (w/v) alginate solutions containing 0, 5, 10, and 15 mM CaCl 2. The solutions 
were vortexed for one minute and left in the refrigerator overnight to ensure homogenous 
mixing.
Rheological studies.
Rheological measurements were performed using an AR-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments). 
For characterization of peptide-functionalized hydrogels, an 8 mm standard steel parallel 
plate geometry with a measurement gap of 1 mm was used. A dynamic oscillatory frequency 
sweep from 0.5 to 100 rad/s at 1% strain was used to compare storage and loss modulus 
between hydrogel groups. A solvent trap was used to keep gels hydrated during testing. For 
characterization of partially crosslinked RGD and MMPQK-functionalized alginate 
precursors, a 25 mm standard steel parallel plate geometry with a measurement gap of 500 
μm was used. A shear rate ramp from 0.001 to 1000 (1/s) was used to evaluate the flow of 
the solutions and find yield stress. A dynamic oscillatory frequency sweep from 0.1 to 10 Hz 
at 1% strain was used to measure storage and loss modulus. All measurements were taken at 
room temperature and a two-minute equilibration step was performed before each run.
Printability studies.
The capability of partially crosslinked alginate to successfully print a computer-designed 
lattice structure was evaluated using a point-to-point fabrication method (detailed next 
section). Alginate solutions were dyed with red food coloring for visualization. Cell 
sedimentation in the partially crosslinked alginate was evaluated using glass pipette tips with 
an agarose plug at the end. HUVECs and hADSCs were stained with Calcein-AM before 
being suspended 2:1 in partially crosslinked alginate at a total density of 3 million cells/mL 
and pipetted into the glass tips. The tips were left upright at room temperature for 3 hours 
before being visualized with fluorescent microscopy. Cell viability was assessed in 
hydrogels immediately post-printing using a LIVE/DEAD cell viability assay according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions (Cat.# L3224, Thermofisher). To evaluate bioprinting 
consistency, lattice structures were sequentially bioprinted (n = 4) with 15 mM partially 
crosslinked bioink and the images of the structures were captured. The length (x-axis) and Barrs et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptwidth (y-axis) at three different sections of each construct, as well as pore diameter, were 
measured and compared among all the constructs to determine the repeatability and 
consistency of printing using the partially crosslinked bioink. To evaluate printing accuracy 
compared to a CAD model, a lattice structure was designed through Visual PathBuilder 
software (Ratioserv). The printing was performed to fabricate the structures based on the 
CAD design and after printing, the length (x-axis), width (y-axis) and pore diameter of the 
printed structures were measured (n≥3) and compared to the original CAD design to 
determine the relative percent accuracy according to the following equation: Percent 
accuracy = 1- |( DCAD−Dprint)/DCAD|⋅100%, where DCAD and Dprint are the dimensions of 
the CAD-designed construct and actual printed construct, respectively.
Bioprinting process.
All bioprinting in this study was performed on the Palmetto Printer - a fully automated, 
piston-driven bioprinter at the Medical University of South Carolina. The Palmetto Printer 
has three interchangeable dispensers, a temperature-controlled printing surface, and HEPA 
filtration system. The bioprinter was sealed under positive pressure and sterilized with UV 
light for at least 10 minutes before printing syringes were loaded. To fabricate a vascularized 
tissue unit, two dispensers were used – one containing our vasculogenic bioink (vascular 
component) and the other a fibroblast-containing bioink (tissue component). The 
vasculogenic bioink contained alginate functionalized with 5% (w/w) RGD and MMPQK 
peptides. The fibroblast-containing bioink was alginate functionalized with 5% (w/w) RGD 
only. The bioinks were dissolved in cell culture media at 2% (w/v) concentration and 
partially crosslinked as described in a previous section. To fabricate a heterogenous VTU, 
RFP-HUVECs and hADSCs were suspended in the vasculogenic bioink in a 2:1 ratio (RFP-
HUVEC:ADSC) at a total cell density of 5 million cells/mL. To fabricate a mixed VTU, 
RFP-HUVECs, hADSCs, and GFP-hDFs were suspended in the vasculogenic bioink in a 
2:1:1 ratio (RFP-HUVEC:ADSC:GFP-hDF) at a total cell density of 5 million cells/mL. For 
both heterogenous and mixed VTUs, GFP-hDFs were loaded at a density of 2 million 
cells/mL in the fibroblast-containing bioink. The cell-laden bioinks were loaded into sterile, 
printer-compatible syringes with 20 ga. dispensing tips before being transported to the 
bioprinter. Printing speed was 10 μL/sec and droplet volume was 230 nL A CaCl 2-
containing substrate was maintained at 4°C on the printing plate to prevent the gelatin from 
melting. A point-to-point method was used to print the Vascularized Tissue Unit construct. 
First, the vasculogenic bioink was printed into a single-layer lattice construct by depositing 
an outline of dots separated by 600 μm and then printing dots between the gaps of the 
outline, allowing the dots to combine and make a cohesive structure. Fibroblasts were then 
printed into the voids of the lattice with a second dispenser to form the tissue component 
(~1.2 mm diameter). After printing was completed, the constructs were left to fully crosslink 
on the CaCl 2-containing substrate for 15 minutes. Then, 4 mL of culture media was added, 
and the petri dish was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes to allow the gelatin substrate to 
melt. The constructs were removed from the dish and individually placed into wells of a 12-
well plate. The constructs were cultured in media containing 50% EGM-2, 25% ADSC-GM, 
25% FGM-2, and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (Pen Strep). Media was changed every other 
day.Barrs et al. Page 7

Porcine gelatin (3% wt.), sodium chloride (0.9% wt.), calcium chloride (100 mM), and 
titanium dioxide (2% wt.) were added to distilled, deionized water, and boiled to dissolve the 
gelatin. For cell behavior studies, the substrate was distributed into the wells of a 96-well 
plate. For bioprinting, 5 mL aliquots were pipetted into standard petri dishes and left to 
solidify overnight at 4°C. Addition of titanium dioxide increased the substrate’s opacity so 
that position sensing lasers on the bioprinter could detect the printing surface.
Statistical analysis.
All variables were expressed as means ± standard deviations (S.D.). One-way ANOV A with 
Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used to compare percent porosity of functionalized 
alginate hydrogels, vascular morphogenesis parameters between RGD+MMPQK, RGD 
only, and MMPQK only hydrogels, yield stress and zero shear viscosity among partially 
crosslinked alginate solutions, and construct dimensions among sequentially printed lattices. 
A Student’s t-test was used to compare vascular morphogenesis with or without VEGF, 
angiogenic sprouting from the strut and junction regions in the printed VTU, and ECM 
deposition in the vascular and tissue components. Two-way ANOV A with Tukey’s multiple 
comparisons test was used to compare storage and loss modulus among peptide-
functionalized alginates. For all analyses, a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Vasculogenic hydrogel matrix design and synthesis.
Native alginate is bioinert and non-degradable. In our previous work, we developed 
strategies to engineer alginate as a cytocompatible, biodegradable bioink through cell-
adhesive peptide modification and partial oxidization.42 To ensure a high conjugation 
efficiency between the alginate and peptides, we utilized CuAAC “click” chemistry-
mediated bioconjugation in this study (Figure 1A).
In addition to RGDSP, which targets multiple integrins (e.g. αvβ3) involved in angiogenesis 
and vascular development43, MMPQK peptides were used to further promote vascular 
morphogenesis44–47 through cell-demanded release from the alginate matrix and binding of 
VEGF receptors48–52 (Figure 1B, C). The inclusion of MMPQK was intended to mimic the 
sequestration of matrix-bound VEGF via MMPs released from migratory endothelial cells, 
which is essential for vascular patterning.53, 54 Together, these two peptide ligands were 
selected for vasculogenic bioink development as the cross-activation between integrins (i.e. 
αvβ3) and VEGF receptors in endothelial cells has been reported to synergistically induce 
angiogenic signaling.55–57
Chemical and physical characterization of peptide-functionalized alginate hydrogels.
The success of conjugation between alginates and peptides was monitored by LC-MS. 
Notably, there was no detectable peptide in the liquid residual after reaction, indicating the 
completion of the conjugating reaction (Figure 2A). We further validated the degree of 
peptide functionalization using 1H-NMR (Figure S1, Supporting Information), and found Barrs et al. Page 8
Biomacromolecules . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 February 08.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthat RGD and MMPQK peptides were successfully conjugated to alginate at 0.135 mmol/g 
(peptide/alginate powder) and 0.148 mmol/g, respectively. As mechanical properties (e.g., 
elasticity) of hydrogels have been shown to significantly affect vascular morphogenesis58, 59, 
we examined the storage and loss modulus of 2% (w/v) peptide-functionalized alginates. We 
found similar values across all conditions (Figure 2B), indicating the similar physical macro-
environment of these hydrogels. Further, the microstructures of the peptide-functionalized 
alginate hydrogels showed similar pore structures and porosity percentage values (Figure 
2C) as calculated from binarized SEM images (Figure S2, Supporting Information). 
Together, these data indicated that peptides were successfully conjugated to the alginate 
matrices and that the hydrogels had similar mechanical and microstructural properties, 
providing a controlled environment to study peptide effects on vascular morphology in 
subsequent analyses.
Vascular morphogenesis in functionalized alginate hydrogels.
To examine the effects of RGD and MMPQK peptides on microvascular network formation, 
RFP-expressing HUVECs and hADSCs were encapsulated in 2% (w/v) peptide-
functionalized alginate hydrogels and cultured for 7 days. Vascular morphogenesis was 
quantified by HUVEC fractional area, average vessels length, and junctions/mm2 (Figure 
3A, B). All three metrics were significantly improved in the hydrogels functionalized with 
both RGD and MMPQK peptides compared to hydrogels functionalized with either peptide 
alone. These results support previous findings that coactivation of integrins and VEGF 
receptors results in synergistic signaling that enhances vascular morphogenesis.55, 60–62 To 
study the potential vasculogenic effects of soluble VEGF63 in the culture media, we 
removed the VEGF supplement from the media. We found that removing VEGF from the 
media led to insignificant changes in vascular morphogenesis in the RGD+MMPQK 
hydrogels (Figure 3C, D). This suggests that the observed vascular network formation did 
not rely on the soluble VEGF present in the culture media.
Importantly, coculture with hADSCs was required for the formation of endothelial cord-like 
networks (Figure 3A). Without hADSCs, vascular morphogenesis was severely limited and 
HUVECs retained a round morphology after 7 days. These results agreed with previously 
observed cooperation between hADSCs and endothelial cells during vasculogenesis.64, 65 
Colocalization of HUVECs and hADSCs was observed at day 7 in co-culture (Figure S3, 
Supporting Information), further indicating that hADSCs directly interacted with 
microvascular networks.
To analyze the maturation of microvascular networks formed in the 2% (w/v) RGD
+MMPQK functionalized alginate hydrogels, we extended the culture period. At day 14, 
extensive microvascularization was observed within the hydrogels and HUVECs had 
assembled into lumenized networks (Figure 3E). This was a significant observation given the 
defined composition of the hydrogels and the static culture conditions. Hollow lumens were 
found within these networks as evidenced by 3D reconstruction and, notably, the lumens had 
a diameter of approximately 9 μm (Figure 3F), which falls within the range of capillaries.66 
While some laser-based bioprinting techniques can fabricate channels of this scale, 
endogenous capillary network formation facilitated by vasculogenic biomaterials is a more Barrs et al. Page 9

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptfacile, biomimetic approach for direct capillarization. We reason that in our alginate matrix, 
HUVECs form lumenized networks by simultaneously binding to RGD peptides via αvβ3 
integrins, and proteolytically demanding the release of MMPQK peptides throughout 
migration as the hydrogel degrades through hydrolysis during culture. Interestingly, previous 
literature has also highlighted similar required factors (integrin and VEGFR activation) for 
vascular network formation in an engineered MMP-labile crosslinker composed hyaluronic 
acid matrix.67
Processing peptide-functionalized hydrogel precursors into a viscoelastic bioink via 
partial crosslinking.
The rheological properties of a bioink are directly correlated with its printability.17, 68–73 
The 2% (w/v) alginate solution was initially not suitable for high fidelity bioprinting because 
of its low viscosity (<1 Pa·s).42 Increasing the polymer concentration to raise the viscosity 
was not appropriate as a concentration of only 4% (w/v) alginate inhibited network 
formation (Figure S4, Supporting Information) and was still not viscous enough to print. To 
improve the printability of the low-concentration alginate bioink, we employed a partial 
ionic crosslinking approach to increase the viscosity of the alginate solutions. Gradually 
adding aqueous calcium chloride (CaCl 2) to 4% (w/v) peptide-functionalized alginate at a 
1:1 (v/v) ratio progressively crosslinked the alginate hydrogel precursor into a more viscous 
solution, but not a fully solidified hydrogel (Figure 4A).
We then used the partial crosslinking strategy to modify the rheological properties of the 
peptide-functionalized alginate solutions, as these attributes (i.e. yield stress, shear thinning, 
viscoelasticity) directly influence printability.73–75 Alginate solutions containing 0 mM or 5 
mM CaCl 2 exhibited exceptionally low yield stress (<0.01 Pa) while the 10 mM and 15 mM 
CaCl 2 crosslinked solutions exhibited non-linear pseudoplastic fluid behavior with 
significantly higher yield stresses (Figure 4B, C). Since alginate exhibits non-Newtonian 
fluid behavior, the Herschel-Bulkley model was used to calculate the yield stress of partially 
crosslinked alginate solutions76 (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The 10 mM solution 
had a yield stress of 1.7 ± 0.3 Pa, while the 15 mM solution was significantly higher at 5.3 ± 
0.3 Pa (Figure 4C). The viscosity of the 15 mM solutions declined rapidly in a shear rate 
sweep, exhibiting highly shear thinning behavior (Figure 4D). Based on the Cross model77, 
the zero shear viscosity of the 15 mM solution (471.8 ± 43.73 Pa.s) was over an order of 
magnitude greater than that of the 10 mM solution (15.63 ± 9.75 Pa.s) and more than two 
orders of magnitude greater than that of the 0 and 5 mM solutions (both <1 Pa.s) (Figure 4E 
and Figure S6, Supporting Information). Therefore, the viscosity of the 15 mM solution was 
most suitable for bioprinting. The 15 mM CaCl 2 solution demonstrated stable viscoelastic 
properties, as the storage modulus (G’) was larger than the loss modulus (G”) during a 
frequency sweep from 0.1 to 10 Hz (Figure 4F). The 20 mM CaCl 2 crosslinked alginate was 
not evaluated as it could not be loaded into a printing syringe due to complete gelation and, 
therefore, would be incompatible with bioprinting. By partially crosslinking the alginate 
hydrogel precursor with an optimal concentration of crosslinker before printing, we were 
able to meet several major rheological criteria for printable bioinks without increasing 
polymer concentration. Through the above optimization, we successfully formulated 
alginate into a viscoelastic fluid which meets several major rheological criteria for printable Barrs et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptbioinks without increasing polymer concentration. These results agree with previous reports 
that have used partial crosslinking to improve the printability of low-concentration alginate 
bioinks for tissue engineering.23, 78 However, we have reformed this strategy to improve the 
printability of a proangiogenic hydrogel bioink for direct vascularized bioprinting.
Printability of the partially crosslinked vasculogenic hydrogel bioink.
Since the 2% (w/v) vasculogenic alginate solution partially crosslinked with 15 mM CaCl 2 
was the most suitable candidate for bioprinting, we next evaluated its printability according 
to several benchmarks. Since bioprinting complex tissues and organs may require hours-long 
printing times, we firstly performed a sedimentation test with HUVECs and hADSCs to 
evaluate the ability of the bioink candidate to keep these cells homogenously suspended for 
a prolonged printing time (3 hours). Most of the cells in the non-partially crosslinked 
alginate sank to the bottom of the reservoir after 3 hours, while cells remained 
homogenously suspended in the partially crosslinked alginate (15 mM CaCl 2) (Figure 5A). 
This demonstrated the capacity of the bioink to prevent sedimentation of encapsulated cells 
over a 3-hour printing period, which is important since sedimentation during printing would 
result in inhomogeneous cell deposition in the final construct. Importantly, most of the cells 
were still viable after 3 hours, as indicated by the live-cell Calcein-AM staining used to label 
the cells in the reservoir.
When utilized to print a lattice structure in a drop-on-demand approach (Video S1, 
Supporting Information), the partially crosslinked alginate (15 mM CaCl 2) successfully 
printed a cohesive lattice, whereas a disconnected lattice was printed when using the non-
partially crosslinked alginate (Figure 5B), which could be attributed to partially crosslinked 
strategy significantly improving printing resolution (Figure 5C). A homogenous distribution 
of cells was observed in the printed lattice structure using partially crosslinked alginate (15 
mM CaCl 2) (Figure S7, Supporting Information), consistent with the results of the 
sedimentation test. We further evaluated the printing consistency and accuracy of the 
partially crosslinked bioink by sequentially printing lattice constructs and comparing their 
dimensions amongst themselves as well as to the original CAD design. The mean print 
accuracy was >90% for all construct dimensions (i.e. length, width, and pore size) compared 
to the original CAD design (Figure 5D) and there was no significant difference in construct 
dimensions among sequentially printed constructs (Figure 5E). Therefore, the partially 
crosslinked bioink printed constructs with excellent repeatability and accuracy. In addition, 
most cells (>90%) remained viable after printing (Figure 5F). This could be attributed to the 
shear thinning properties of alginate-based hydrogels79, wherein the physically crosslinked 
matrix undergoes a reversible gel-sol transition during extrusion, shielding suspended cells 
from shear stresses at the nozzle orifice.80
Combined with the outcomes of rheological tests, these results demonstrated that partially 
crosslinking alginate hydrogel precursor provides an effective strategy to process low-
viscosity vasculogenic hydrogels into printable bioinks for bioprinting microvascularized 
tissues.Barrs et al. Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptFabricating heterogenous vascularized tissue with the vasculogenic bioink.
To validate the capacity of our bioink for direct printing of microvascularized tissues, we 
fabricated a VTU, which is a heterogenous soft tissue construct composed of vascular and 
tissue-specific components to mimic stromal and parenchymal elements of soft tissues.81, 82 
Using a multi-nozzle bioprinter, the vascular component was printed first with our 
vasculogenic bioink in a lattice structure. A second nozzle was then used to print tissue-
specific “buds” within the voids of the lattice. For the tissue component, we used an RGD-
functionalized bioink containing GFP-hDFs (Figure 6A). Dermal fibroblasts were used as a 
proof-of-concept for the tissue component as they maintain the ECM in the dermis layer of 
the skin and modulate wound healing.83
After printing, the vascular and tissue components could be distinguished in a cohesive 
structure under bright-field microscopy and cells appeared homogenously distributed in both 
components (Figure 6B). After 7 days in culture, the vascular component contained 
extensive microvascular networks in the strut and junction regions that sprouted into the 
tissue component (Figure 6C, D). Importantly, the RGD+MMQPK bioink promoted greater 
CD31+ fractional area coverage and average vessels length by RFP-HUVECs within the 
vascular component compared to the RGD only bioink (Figure S8, Supporting Information), 
indicating that the RGD+MMPQK bioink significantly promotes a vascular-specific 
phenotype and function of endothelial cells compared to RGD-functionalized alginate, 
which is a state-of-the-art peptide-functionalized alginate bioink for vascularized 
bioprinting. The average invasion depth of microvasculature from the vascular component 
(either from the junction part of the structure or from the strut part of the structure) into the 
tissue component was around 200 μm at day 7 (Figure S9, Supporting Information). 
Interestingly, NG2+ mural cells were found tightly colocalized with RFP-HUVECs in the 
vascular component, indicating a pericyte-like functional role of hADSCs for vascular 
development in the construct, consistent with previous literature84, 85 (Figure 6E).
After extended culture for 14 days, average invasion depth from the vascular component into 
the tissue component had tripled to around 650 μm (Figure S10, Supporting Information). 
Remarkably, vascular invasion into the tissue component was only observed in a 
heterogenous VTU construct, wherein dermal fibroblasts were printed only in the tissue 
component and not in the vascular component. When dermal fibroblasts were printed in the 
vascular component along with RFP-HUVECs and hADSCs (“mixed” VTU), we observed 
no invasion into the tissue component (Figure S10, Supporting Information). This validated 
the biomimetic design of the VTU with compartmentalized vascular components and tissue 
components. This is also in agreement with a recent study that demonstrated enhanced 
vascularization in a heterogenous, compartmentalized muscle tissue construct compared to a 
homogenous, mixed construct.22 These results show that the RGD+MMPQK bioink can 
effectively promote vascular network invasion at a heterogenous tissue interface.
Additionally, we observed endogenous deposition of fibronectin, a key ECM protein 
involved in blood vessel formation86, 87, in the vascular component of the VTU (Figure 7A). 
Compared to the tissue component, there was significantly greater fibronectin deposition in 
the vascular component (Figure 7B), indicating promotion of vascular-specific matrix 
assembly by the RGD and MMPQK peptides. Compared to the deposition of fibronectin in Barrs et al. Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe vascular component, significantly more type I collagen was observed in tissue 
components, indicating normal function of fibroblasts (Figure S11, Supporting Information).
Collectively, these results not only provided in situ evidence of the ability of our bioink to 
support vascular morphogenesis, but they also demonstrate the feasibility of designing 
peptide-functionalized bioinks for direct fabrication of heterogenous microvascularized 
tissue components. The bioink developed in this study could be applied in other multi-
material or multi-nozzle techniques to print a variety of complex vascularized tissue-specific 
constructs. The presently described VTU could have immediate applications in wound 
healing or as a modular in vitro vascularized test bed for drug toxicity assays.88 However, 
the bioink used to print the tissue component of the VTU needs to be further optimized to 
accelerate vascular invasion from the vascular component, as portions of the tissue 
component were still not vascularized at Days 7 and 14. Future studies could also explore 
the feasibility of fabricating VTUs containing other parenchymal cell types in the tissue 
component (ex. cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, etc.) for vascularized organ-on-chip 
models. For example, Hooper and others proposed using vascular-specific and neural-
specific hydrogel bioinks to fabricate a neurovascular unit (NVU) that could be used to study 
neurovascular function and dysfunction in vitro.89 The modularity of the VTU makes it a 
conceivable platform for bottom-up manufacturing of vascularized soft tissues for various 
tissue engineering applications, though in vivo studies are necessary to determine the 
capacity of the VTU to anastomose with host vasculature.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, a vasculogenic alginate hydrogel bioink with defined chemistry was developed 
to recapitulate functional cues of the natural ECM and promote microvascular network 
formation in bioprinted tissue constructs. Chemical modification with RGDSP and MMPQK 
peptides provided a defined, tunable matrix for directly promoting endogenous 
microvascularization and established a foundational biomaterial for subsequent processing 
into an animal origin-free bioink engineered for bioprinting microvasculature.
While the hydrogel precursor was initially not printable, converting the low-viscosity 
solution into a printable bioink was accomplished with a partial crosslinking strategy, 
avoiding the need to increase polymer concentration, which would impede vascular 
morphogenesis. Furthermore, this strategy circumvented the need for blending with 
chemically undefined biomaterials like gelatin or collagen, preserving the defined chemical 
nature of our bioink matrix. By thoroughly characterizing rheological properties governing 
bioprintability, we demonstrated that partial crosslinking of alginate hydrogels is a facile 
approach to significantly improving the printability of low viscosity alginate bioinks. While 
bio-inert partially crosslinked alginate has been used previously by Tabriz and others to print 
alginate hydrogel structures with cells to demonstrate biocompatibility of the partial 
crosslinking strategy78, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time partial 
crosslinking has been employed to develop a bioactive, peptide-functionalized alginate 
hydrogel bioink for printing heterogenous, vascularized soft tissue while satisfying 
rheological and printability for bioprinting. Our bioink would be amenable to other robotic 
dispensing methods, such as freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels Barrs et al. Page 13

our bioink could complement sacrificial bioprinting approaches to promote direct 
capillarization of constructs with larger, perfusable macrovasculature.
Future work will seek to optimize the tissue-specific bioink formulation, design of the VTU, 
and bioprinting technique to achieve complete prevascularization of the bioprinted 
constructs. These studies could also focus on using other peptides targeting multiple types of 
integrin/growth factor receptors or combinatorial crosslinking strategies (e.g. physical and 
chemical crosslinking strategies) to further tune the bioactivities of the alginate and reinforce 
its mechanical properties, respectively. It is also feasible to design and fabricate VTUs 
containing other tissue-specific cell types (e.g. cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, neurons, etc.) 
to recapitulate heterogenous vascularized tissue/organ components (e.g. heart, liver, brain, 
etc.). The bioink developed here expands the availability of printable, chemically defined 
proangiogenic bioink alternatives to protein-based hydrogels like collagen, gelatin, Matrigel, 
etc. for vascularized bioprinting. The defined nature of the reported vasculogenic bioink 
matrix makes it a promising, translational “off-the-shelf” bioink platform for robust 
fabrication of microvasculature and direct microvascularization of bioprinted tissues.

1.Introduction 
3D printing (3DP) processes have evolved from simple prototyping 
for visual inspection purposes to functional product manufacturing that 
offers flexibility, customization, scalability, reliability, durability, and 
relatively high speed. These processes have been successfully applied to 
the biomedical field by unraveling previously inaccessible freedom 
layers, such as increased design complexity. Bioprinting falls under the 
3DP processes category that has helped to develop more advanced 
research-specific experimental tools and patient-specific therapeutic 
approaches. Bioprinting aims to manufacture living functional tissues 
and organs suitable for transplantation by combining living cells, scaf-
folds with 3D interconnected structures, and bioactive agents. There -
fore, simultaneous processing of living cells and various biomaterials are 
needed in 3D bioprinting and its applications. 
Ideal material for bioprinting must be biocompatible, i.e., induce 
appropriate host response specific for its intended application. It must 
also preferably be biodegradable to create space for and be replaced by 
newly synthesized tissue in time. The implanted material must provide 
the appropriate biological and biomechanical environments and 
biomechanical functions close to the native host within the body [1]. 
Standards are also critical to the advancement of science and engineering in bioprinting. They should cover a wide range of activities, 
from simple laboratory procedures to the control of complex biological 
processes. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
specified the nonclinical biocompatibility and medical device testing in 
the ‘ISO 10993-Biological evaluation of medical devices ’ standard se-
ries. In particular, ISO 10993-1 provides the overall classification of 
medical devices. It gives algorithms for configuring the steps required in 
planning the study in which the biological safety of any biomaterial or 
medical device is determined [2]. However, there are still no standards 
addressing the bioprinting processes, production of biocompatible and 
bio printable materials (i.e., bio-inks), or characterization methods of 
the final products [3]. On the other hand, significant research efforts 
have been invested in transposing 3DP technology to the medical field, 
as indicated by the significantly increased publications (Fig. 1). 
In addition to the scientific community ’s interest, commercial com-
panies have also shown great interest in bioprinting. EnvisionTEC ’s 
Bioplotter [4] is the first commercial bioprinter that can produce tissue 
scaffolds from various biomaterials. The Chemical Institute of Sarria 
produced two different hydroxyapatite (HA) containing inks for 3D 
bioprinters [5]. Objet/Stratasys launched a transparent biocompatible 
photopolymer (MED610) [6], which creates rigid and transparent parts, 
such as surgical guides for a dental implant or orthopedic procedures.

2Autodesk teamed up with Orgonovo and developed commercial soft-
ware for 3D bioprinting for the first time [7]. Orgonovo ’s NovoGen 
MMX was considered the first commercial bioprinter tested for a fully 
cellular product [8]. 
Given ongoing research progress in this field, a comprehensive re-
view of existing achievements is vital. This review aims to present recent 
advances in 3DP processes with a particular focus on bioprinting. This 
study presents the history and development of bioprinting processes, the 
material developments in this field, and their applications. The selected 
bioprinting applications in the fabrication of 3D tissue-engineered 
constructs for bone, osteochondral, skin, and cardiac reconstruction 
are presented to demonstrate its potential in the further advancement of 
this multidisciplinary field of research and development. 
2.3D printing processes & biomaterials 
3DP processes utilize digital models obtained using 3D modeling 
software or digital scanning data. The designed models in computer- 
aided design (CAD) software are converted into an STL (standard 
tessellation language) file to represent objects in a three-dimensional 
cartesian coordinate system, storing information about objects ’ surface 
geometry, excluding color, texture, and other virtual model-related in-
formation. To be interpreted by the 3DP hardware (i.e., 3D printer), the 
STL file is further processed by a so-called “slicer software ” to generate a 
machine-friendly file (.gcode file) [9,10]. The slicing software adds 
machine-specific extra information to the obtained slicing data. The 
ASTM/ISO standard defines terminologies used in 3DP technology and 
classifies the different 3DP techniques into seven sub-groups: material 
extrusion, material jetting, binder jetting, vat photopolymerization, 
powder bed fusion, directed energy deposition, and sheet object lami-
nation [11]. Bioprinting processes have evolved from the traditional 
3DP methods. Three out of seven generally classified 3DP processes have 
been implanted for bioprinting so far, as shown in Fig. 2. 
3D printing materials are chosen according to the target application. 
3DP processes are compatible with different material types: polymers, 
ceramics, metals, and composites. Polymers are often readily available 
and cost-effective, making them one of the most preferred strategies for 
3D demonstration, prototyping, simulation, and actual applications 
[12], such as printing tissue scaffolds with PCL [13]. Ceramics, such as 
alumina, silica, and zirconia, are rigid ceramics that are hard to manu -
facture through conventional manufacturing processes. 3DP opened 
new and exciting perspectives in terms of manufacturing parts from 
ceramic materials. Biocompatible ceramics, such as hydroxyapatite 
(HA), can be processed with 3DP for biomedical applications. Ceramics 
have been successfully used as building materials for most 3DP tech-
nologies such as FDM [14–16] and SLS [17]. The majority of the 
load-bearing implants, such as artificial joints (for instance, a hip joint), 
spinal fixation devices, fracture nails, bone plates, and screws, and dental implants, are fabricated from metallic biomaterials (e.g., titanium 
and its alloys, cobalt alloy, and 316L stainless steel), since they have 
good mechanical reliability [18]. 
Given the current advances in 3D printing technologies and mate-
rials, 3DP has found widespread use in biomaterials, regenerative 
medicine and tissue engineering, and laboratory device prototyping 
[19–21]. In the medical field, 3DP can also be used for aims such as 
teaching [22], functional flow modeling [23], procedural planning [24, 
25], and device engineering [22]. Although 3DP medical applications 
are still in early-stage, past and current studies show promising results 
and imply a bright future for the field. One of the main advantages of 
employing 3DP in the medical field is its ability to produce 
patient-specific devices and therapeutic approaches. Some examples of 
materials used in 3DP are summarized in Table 1. 
The working principles of all the 3DP processes and biomaterials 
involved are presented in the following sections. The subsequent text 
mainly comprise two main sub-sections, “section 2.1” presents the 3DP 
processes adaptation and modifications and biomaterials for bio-
printing, while “section 2.2” presents other 3DP processes briefly for 
general biomedical sciences.

32.1. Bioprinting 
In 2004, the definition of bioprinting was presented in the first in-
ternational workshop on bioprinting and bio-patterning. The term refers 
to using material transfer processes to design and assemble molecules, 
cells, tissues, and biodegradable biomaterials according to a specified 
configuration to perform one or more biological functions [72]. Bio-
printing aims to manufacture living functional tissues and organs suit-
able for transplantation by combining living cells, scaffolds with 3D 
interconnected structures, and bioactive agents. Therefore, simulta -
neous processing of living cells and various biomaterials are needed in 
3D bioprinting applications. 
Standard 3D printing devices were first developed for rapid proto -
typing, rapid tooling for industrial manufacturing, and consumer 
product fabrication. These technologies ’ hostile environment makes 
them incompatible with 3D printing of living cells and many biological 
materials. Thus, limiting their biomedical applications to “passive ” 
biological structures, such as bare scaffolds and highly porous sub-
strates, which are often used as an adherence surface for cell growth and 
proliferation. Bio-friendly printing technologies have been developed to 
overcome these limitations. To date, vat polymerization, material 
extrusion, and material jetting technologies are adopted for bioprinting 
applications. 3D bioprinting devices can be designed as ink-jet, micro- 
extrusion, and laser-assisted systems [58], which corresponds to the 
mentioned standard 3DP processes. These technologies and material 
development for these processes are discussed here. 
2.1.1. Vat polymerization (VP) 
2.1.1.1. Stereolithography (SLA). Stereolithography (SLA), a vat poly-
merization method, was the first-ever introduced 3DP process [73]. In 
SLA, an ultraviolet (UV) range laser is used to induce polymerization of 
photopolymer resins (e.g., elastomers, epoxies, or acrylate) [74]. A pair 
of Galvano-scanners control the laser beam ’s lateral motion to improve 
printing speed and accuracy (Fig. 3). As a resin is used as the base ma-
terial, the printing speed is tightly correlated with the light penetration 
and the curing depth, affecting new layer deposition. These parameters 
can be improved by modulating the resin viscosity, adding light ab-
sorbers, and polymerization facilitators. 
Typically, SLA resins are made of polymers such as acrylates and 
epoxies. However, it is necessary to note that acrylate is not preferred for 
biomedical applications, given its cytotoxicity. Alternatively, novel 
biocompatible materials have been developed to overcome such mate-
rial limitation issues, such as poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is an FDA-approved 
polymer [75]. The first use of SLA in the cell-containing bioprinting 
process was in 2004 [76]. An SLA vat was filled with Chinese hamster 
ovary cells and a photo-curable hydrogel consisting of poly(ethylene 
oxide) (PEO) and poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate (PEGDM) and 
Irgacure was employed as a photo-initiator. The container was then placed on a vertically moving table. UV light cured the places according 
to the design until the 3D structure was completed. The cell density was 
high with a laser intensity of 18 mW/cm2 and wavelength of UV light of 
365 nm. There is an increasing scientific interest in non-UV-based sys-
tems since UV can damage the DNA of encapsulated cells [77] and yield 
low post-printing cell viability. Lin et al. [78] developed a visible 
light-based projection SLA and used polyethylene glycol diacrylate 
(PEGDA) monomer to create hydrogel-based scaffolds with improved 
cell viability. Wang et al. [79] also used visible light-based SLA with a 
bio-ink consisting of PEGDA and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel 
with an eosin Y-based photo-initiator. This system produced a vertical 
3D structure with 50 μm resolution and 85% fibroblast cell viability for 
the first five days. 
2.1.1.2. Digital light processing (DLP). Digital light processing (DLP) 
also relies on UV light-induced polymerization of the resin. The signif -
icant difference between these two technologies resides in that DLP in-
duces an instantaneous entire layer polymerization using digital micro- 
mirrors devices (DMD) [80,81]. In contrast, in SLA, a single laser point 
(e.g., layer pixel) is exposed at a time. As a result, DLP offers a higher 
printing speed than SLA and all other 3DP technology competitors 
(Fig. 3). The slicing data numerically control the DMD configuration. 
The applied light source has also evolved from standard lamps to 
light-emitting diode covering, thus, a more comprehensive range of 
wavelength at a lower cost [82]. The hardware setup for DLP offers 
higher lateral printing resolution. The z-resolution is tightly correlated 
with light penetration and scattering, which can be improved by adding 
light absorbers and polymerization facilitators. DLP achieves a resolu -
tion of about 1 μm (while the printing speed is about 30 mm3 s 1) 
regardless of the layer ’s lateral area and complexity [83]. 
DLP can be employed with pure polymers (e.g., poly (lactic acid) 
(PLA) and poly- ε-caprolactone (PCL)) and composites containing 
ceramic and metal particles [84]. PLA resin compatible with the DLP 
method was synthesized and functionalized by methacrylic anhydride to 
produce hard tissue scaffolds with 600- μm pore size and 70% nominal 
porosity [85]. Seck et al. [78] fabricated the hydrogel scaffolds of poly 
D, L-lactide (PDLLA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) by the DLP method. 
The scaffolds had a gyroid structure with pore sizes ranging from 387 to 
558 μm with 15 μm layer thickness. 
SLA and DLP are employed in the biomedical field to address various 
applications, including patient-specific models and functional parts, 
implantable devices, cell-free tissue engineering scaffolds, and cell- 
containing hydrogels [74]. Besides having high resolution, both SLA 
and DLP have the advantages of being cell-compatible techniques. 
2.1.1.3. Two-photon polymerization (2 PP). Two-photon polymerization 
(2 PP) is another vat polymerization-based printing system like SLA and 
DLP, but it can provide better control and higher print quality [86]. Due 
to single-photon polymerization in SLA, the process occurs on the 
Fig. 3.(a) SLA and (b) DLP printers (Working Principle).  B. Yilmaz et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioprinting 23 (2021) e00148
4surface of a photosensitive resin that only allows building 3D structures 
layer by layer. On the other hand, in 2 PP, which uses near-infrared 
(NIR) femtosecond (Fs) laser pulses, the two photons are simulta -
neously absorbed by the photo-initiator. Allowing them to act as a single 
photon to initiate polymerization, enabling direct writing of any desired 
3D model into the volume of photosensitive materials transparent in the 
NIR and highly absorptive in the UV spectral range [87]. 
The first use of the 2 PP technique for constructing 3D hydrogel 
structures containing living cells was reported in 2014 [88]. The human 
osteosarcoma cells (MG63) in the exposure region were reported to be 
damaged by the laser, while the others can survive. Therefore, to ach-
ieve acceptable post-printing viability of cells, it is also essential to 
identify and eliminate the source of photochemical cytotoxicity. Yu et al. 
[89] fabricated cell-free scaffolds of the photoresist by 2 PP containing 
PEGDA as the monomer and pentaerythritol tri-acrylate (PE-3A) 
cross-linker agent and reported that the minimum processing threshold 
was 2.94 mW and the feature line width of 80 nm was achieved. 
2.1.2. Material extrusion (ME) 
Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), also referred to as fused filament 
fabrication (FFF), is the most commonly used material extrusion tech-
nique and was first developed in 1989 and patented by Scott Crump 
[90]. The FDM principle is based on material fusion (primarily plastics), 
extrusion, and deposition. Plastics are fed to the printer in filaments with 
diameters ranging from 1.75 to 3 mm (Fig. 4). The print head is 
equipped with a heating element and a nozzle with a small diameter 
(usually range from 0.1 mm up to 1.0 mm). The material is extruded 
from the printing nozzle upon melting to make a thin filament and then 
laid layer-by-layer on the build plate as specified by the “. gcode ” file. 
The printing resolution is often tightly correlated with various param -
eters such as the nozzle ’s diameter, printing speed, and filament feed 
rate. As illustrated in Fig. 4, one head is dedicated to supporting material 
printing in such configurations, where the other is mainly used for 
model printing. Modern FDM printers can be equipped with dual (or 
multi) printing heads to print supporting materials for complex geom -
etries. In addition, dual heads can be used for extruding multi-materials 
to fabricate functionally graded-materials. 
FDM technology is often used with thermoplastics, such as poly 
(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly (lactic-co-glycolic 
acid) (PLGA). Although there is a limited range of printable materials 
with FDM, this technique is essential due to being practical in easy 
material replacement, low maintenance expense, small size, and flexi-
bility in operating temperatures [91]. Compared to other 3DP technol -
ogies, finished parts of FDM suffer from a low surface quality and dimensional accuracy, limiting their use for various medical applica -
tions. Optimizing the 3D printing process by changing essential pa-
rameters, such as layer thickness, extrusion speed, and infill, must be 
considered to have an improved surface finish. However, several 
post-processing treatment methods, for example, sand polishing, 
chemical treatment with different solvents, such as acetone and 
methyl-ethyl-ketone, and vapor bath smoothening, can also be 
employed [92]. 
The FDM process itself can be applied directly in the biomedical area 
for the rapid casting of biomedical implants by using printed replicas 
[93], fabrication of prosthetic limbs [94] and radiotherapy patient 
simulators (phantoms) [95], 3D printing of microfluidic devices [96], 
sensors [97] and cell-free nanocomposite scaffolds [98], etc. However, 
materials extrusion processes are further modified and adopted for 
bioprinting. The most commonly used extrusion-based bioprinting 
process, namely, extrusion bioprinting (melt extrusion or piston-based), 
originates from FDM technology. The extrusion heads can be pneumatic, 
piston, or screw-driven systems. Landers and Muhlhaupt [43] demon -
strated the efficiency of using an extrusion-based system to construct 3D 
cell-laden hydrogels. The 3D extrusion bioprinting technique is based on 
a viscous cell-laden extrusion through a dosing needle (Fig. 5). Similar to 
conventional 3DP technologies, the needle position is numerically 
controlled based on a CAD model. The 3D structure is then built 
layer-by-layer. Many groups [44–46,99] have evaluated various 
hydrogels and composites to demonstrate the viability of 3D biological 
structures printed with this technology under multiple conditions. 
Extrusion-based bioprinters can be modified to produce 3D struc-
tures composed of multi-walled and core-sheath fibers of different 
compositions using special nozzles with multi-compartments. Besides, it 
is also possible to adopt a microfluidic strategy to extrusion bioprinting 
[100]. Cell-laden bioinks, mainly composed of hydrogels and bioactive 
molecules, are dispensed by the printhead to create 3D structures. 
However, bioinks need to be designed by considering shear thinning or 
fast solidification properties for high-precision production. 
2.1.3. Material jetting (MJ) 
The technology shared by both polyjetting (PJ) and multijet 
modeling (MJM) is the two material jetting methods that were inspired 
by the conventional two-dimensional (2D) printing on papers. Like the 
traditional ink-jet printers, the printer head is equipped with drop-on- 
demand (DOD) ink-jet heads. When heat is applied to the DOD head ’s 
liquid ink, a small air bubble is formed and rapidly collapses, which 
results in a tiny droplet of ink being jetted out of the printhead through a 
small orifice. Piezoelectric actuators can also be used as alternatives to 
heat-induced bubble generation [101], which is particularly interesting 
and valuable in biomedical applications with sensitive temperature re-
quirements. Material jetting printing technology has adopted a similar 
principle with modifications [102–104]. 
In MJM, the printing process is based either on simultaneous jetting

Yilmaz et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioprinting 23 (2021) e00148
5of thermosetting resin and curing agent or, as proposed by Texas In-
strument patents [105], based on wax melting at relatively low tem-
peratures (~70 •C) and rapid solidification upon contact with a cold 
substrate. PJ, on the other hand, is based on UV-curable photopolymers 
[102]. As illustrated in Fig. 6, material drops are deposited during each 
print head pass. A layer of material can be jetted per pass, or, for small 
print heads, only a fraction of a layer is jetted. In the second scenario, 
multiple head passes are required per layer, increasing printing time. 
Next, the build plate moves down one single layer height, and a new 
layer is jetted. This process keeps iterating until the object is con-
structed. A different head is used for overhanging regions to jet support 
material (Fig. 6; green). MJ, given their height accuracy [106], these 
techniques can be applied to medical model fabrication [107] and drug 
delivery simulation [65]. PJ technology is beneficial for multi-materials 
part printing. Thus, it allows for more realistic medical model segmen -
tation printing. PJ technique can be sensitive enough to be used in 3D 
printing of small channels of microfluidic devices [108]. Two most 
commonly used MJ-based bioprinting techniques include 
drop-on-demand and laser-induced forward transfer. 
2.1.3.1. Drop-on-demand (DOD). The first patent for ink-jet printing of 
living cells was obtained in 2006 by Clemson University ’s researchers 
[109]. Droplet-based ink-jet bioprinting is based on the ink-jet tech-
nology mentioned above. The most widely used ink-jet printer types use 
thermal and piezoelectric actuators to produce droplets in the DOD 
principle. The devices with a thermal actuation print head use an electric 
heating unit to form vapor bubbles that expand due to pressure and 
create a bio-ink droplet at the tip of the printhead. Since the process lasts 
only a few microseconds (about 2 μs), even if the temperature can reach 
200–300 •C during the formation of a bubble, the printhead temperature 
only increases up to 10 •C with minimal damage to the biological in-
gredients [110]. Ink-jet bioprinters with piezoelectric heads use voltage 
to induce a rapid deformation of the piezoelectric material. This defor -
mation generates a pressure pulse in the fluid that forces the ink to drop 
from the nozzle. The droplet ’s shape and size can be varied by adjusting 
the voltage applied to the piezoelectric material. 
2.1.3.2. Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT). LIFT consists of a pulsed 
laser source, a focusing system, a ribbon target, and a receiving layer 
(substrate). The ribbon comprises a layer of material containing cells 
and a glass slide covered with an energy absorption layer, typically 
nano-thickness gold or titanium film [58,111]. A laser pulse evaporates 
the metal film to propel a jet of cells and molecules collected on the 
collector substrate [59]. LIFT method can precisely print cells on 
small-sized structures but require rapid hydrogels to obtain high reso-
lution, resulting in low flow rates. Tissue engineering applications of a 
laser-guided direct writing system capable of arranging cells in spatially 
well-defined 3D arrays were reported in 1999 [112]. Such technologies 
allow printing complex biological structures such as mandible and calvarial bone, cartilage, and skeletal muscle [113]. Although 
laser-guided direct writing system bioprinting systems are not 
commercially common, they have many advantages, such as high spatial 
resolution and printing various biological materials, and providing high 
cell viability. 
2.2. Other 3DP processes 
2.2.1. Binder jetting (BJ) 
Binder Jetting (BJ), also known as 3D powder binding technology, 
relies on powdered material (e.g., alumina, etc.) binding by the mean of 
binder material (e.g., colloidal silica, etc.) jetting [114]. This technique 
is similar to conventional ink-jet printing, and traditional ink-jet print-
ing heads are often employed in BJ without further modifications. The 
printing process starts with the dispersion of a thin layer of powder on 
the build plate. The print head jets droplets of binding material on 
specific regions based on the CAD model. The binder induces powder 
particles to fuse, forming a solid layer. Before the full cure of a layer, the 
build platform steps down a few microns (~0.1 mm), and a new layer is 
dispersed by a dispersing roller (Fig. 7). The process iterates over until 
the solid object is entirely constructed. The unbound powder can be used 
as a supporting structure for overhanging regions in the model and 
recycled upon job completion. Often, a build object requires significant 
post-processing steps such as sintering or resin infiltration to improve 
surface finish and mechanical properties. 
BJ is mainly used for pure prototyping and demonstration purposes. 
However, since it is based on ink-jet technology, BJ can produce high- 
fidelity models with multiple colors within individual layers. This 
advantage makes BJ the most preferred approach for 3D visualization, 
planning, and conceptual modeling, particularly in surgical procedures. 
BJ technology can be subdivided into two categories, namely, powder- 
based binder and ink-based binder. In the powder-based binder, the 
binding agent is embedded within the powder particles (PLA, PLGA, 
PCL). When exposed to an aqueous or organic solvent, the powder 
particles swell and fuse by polymer inter-diffusion and entanglement. 
On the other hand, the ink-based binder is mainly preferred for 
constructing an object from metallic or ceramic powder particles. In this 
configuration, the ink-jet head dispenses inorganic (e.g., colloidal silica) 
or organic (e.g., polymeric resins and polymer emulsions) binder on the 
powder particles. The binder firmly binds particles together by forming 
a thin adhesive film upon drying. Alternative binding agents, such as 
citric acid, showed convincing results when used with HA powder, used 
for bone tissue scaffold fabrication in RM [26,27]. 
BJ can also be utilized for the manufacturing of other bioceramics. 
Mancuso et al. [115] prepared different glass-ceramic formulations of 
apatite –wollastonite and silicate-based glasses blended with maltodex -
trin powder as a binder to form micro-and macro-porous bone scaffolds 
for load-bearing applications, and they obtained TE constructs which 
have Young ’s modulus equivalent to the cortical bone after sintering up

Yilmaz et al.

6to 1250 •C. 
BJ is one of the 3DP techniques that is also compatible with biode -
gradable metals. Hong et al. [116] used BJ-3D printing followed by 
binder burn out and subsequent sintering to fabricate biodegradable 
bone tissue engineering scaffolds from Fe, Mn, and Ca powder mixture. 
The corrosion rate of 3D-printed alloys was reported to be greater than 
that of the sintered compact pellets, attributed to the micropores after 
binder burn-out. However, the micropores can also improve osseointe -
gration. 3D printed Fe–Mn-based alloys using the BJ method are also 
studied for craniofacial biomaterial applications [117]. 
2.2.2. Powder bed fusion (PBF) 
Powder bed fusion processes are further classified based on the 
fusion mechanism as; Selective laser sintering (SLS), selective laser 
melting (SLM), and electron beam melting (EBM). SLS is similar to BJ 
since it is also based on bonding the powdered material. However, as 
opposed to BJ, SLS technology uses a focused laser beam to induce layer- 
by-layer local sintering of the powder particles to form a 3D object 
(Fig. 8). 
The principle of SLS consists of powder dispersing on a build plate, a 
numerically controlled focused laser, primarily CO2 and Nd:YAG [118], 
is then used to induce the powder particles fusion (i.e., powder solidi -
fication), then, the build plate is lowered by a single layer height, and 
the process starts again. With laser scanning in SLS, the powder particles 
partially melt and re-solidify, while in SLM, the powders completely 
melt [119]. In EBM, the melting process ’s energy source, i.e., the 
scanning process, is an electron beam emitted from a tungsten filament 
[120]. The process steps are repeated over and over until the final object 
is reconstructed. The unprocessed material is kept being used as a sup-
port for overhanging regions in the model. The container chamber is 
kept at an elevated temperature to improve the curing process and 
decrease processing time. Ideally, the chamber temperature is kept just 
below the material softening point. SLS printing technology allows the 
use of a wide range of materials with specific mechanical properties, 
such as parts that are subject to significantly high mechanical loads. The 
printing resolution and surface finish in SLS are tightly correlated with 
the powder particle size, shape, and density [121]. Thus, one can 
improve the surface finish and reduce the post-processing steps by 
reducing the powder particle size [122,123]. The particle size also af-
fects the density and mechanical properties of the finished product 
[124]. 
Powder bed fusion (PBF) techniques have significant advantages in 
implant fabrication over other 3DP approaches. These methods are the 
most straightforward methods of 3D printing for producing porous or-
thopedic implants directly, and porosity is one of the most critical fea-
tures for bone-in growth and improved osseointegration of metallic 
biomaterials. Additionally, SLS, which applies to polymers, metals, and 
alloy powders, and SLM and EBM compatible with specific metallic 
materials, can fabricate scaffolds and implants with complex geometries 
and open cellular structures [119]. Ceramics, metals, composites, and pure polymers were employed as 
model materials for end-user manufacturing and prototyping parts 
[125–128]. The hostile environment (e.g., high temperature) imposed 
by this technology makes it incompatible with the bioprinting of living 
cells and bioactive molecules. However, SLS technology can still be 
employed in biomedical applications oriented toward bone grafting and 
scaffold printing. In these applications, polyesters such as poly(capro -
lactone) (PCL) [28] and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) [29] are often 
used in combination with calcium phosphate (CaP) particles [30,129]. 
3.Bioprinting applications 
3D bioprinting technologies have found extensive applications in the 
biomedical area, including skin (for example, full-thickness skin sub-
stitutes or wound dressings), orthopedic, dental, osteochondral, car-
diovascular, and other soft tissue engineering applications (for example, 
pancreas and liver). 
3.1. Bone tissue engineering 
Bone is the second most transplanted organ globally, and more than 
four million surgeries are performed each year to treat bone defects 
[130]. Autografting and allografting techniques are still the leading 
solutions in bone repair. Using an autograft is an expensive and invasive 
option and may cause infections and hematomas that frequently affect 
both donor and surgical sites. Besides, allografts have problems such as 
the possibility of causing an immune reaction and subsequent rejection 
by the host tissue; the patient may also be infected if the graft is 
contaminated [131]. 
Biomaterials and engineered structures have become increasingly 
important in bone tissue replacement. Several techniques that have 
previously been used to build TE structures have not been efficient to 
provide vascularity, which is one of the most critical factors affecting the 
success of the structure in the body. Prolonged biodegradation processes 
can occur when bulk materials are used, and this can cause inflamma -
tion reactions. Electrospun nanofiber-based scaffolds of various natural 
and synthetic polymers have been developed to mimic the extracellular 
matrix (ECM). These structures generally do not have enough strength to 
eliminate mechanical mismatch with bone tissue [132]. The difficulties 
encountered in TE constructs ’ production while meeting the clinically 
are the required size, necessary structural support requirements, 
osteoinductivity, and controlled biodegradability [133]. Since all of 
these requirements cannot be fully met by other scaffold production 
methods, bioprinting has received considerable focus within bone TE 
due to its tightly controlled computer-driven fabrication. 
Ceramic scaffolds (such as CaPs and Bioglass) are preferred for their 
biocompatibility, high mechanical strength, controllable biodegrad -
ability, and intrinsic osteoinductivity in hard tissue replacement appli -
cations. Still, they are not usually used in bulk form due to their high 
brittleness. Instead, they are used with biocompatible polymers as 
composites, improving the mixed polymer and ceramics ’ physical 
properties in the final product and printability during the bioprinting 
process. Scaffolds can be printed using ceramic powders (e.g., HA and 
alumina) combined with polymers such as PCL and PLA [26]. For 
instance, previous studies have demonstrated that combining PCL with 
nano-particles reduces its toxicity [51], allowing, thus, its usage as a 
printing substrate [52]. PCL and PLA were both successfully used to 3D 
print porous structures, making them preferred for bone scaffolding 
applications, but a diverse range of polymeric materials available for 
bioprinting technology. Table 2 lists some examples of 3D printed 
composite biomaterials for engineered bone tissues and their osteogenic 
potential. 
Composites consisting of bioceramics can also be 3D-printed via 
various techniques other than material extrusion, such as laser-assisted 
sintering and direct writing-based processes. For example, Ramu et al. 
[139] fabricated bone scaffolds with interconnected cubical and 
 Fig. 8.SLS printer (working principle).  B. Yilmaz et al.

7spherical pores with 40–70% porosity using the SLS method with 
different polyamide and HA mixes. On the other hand, direct printing of 
dense pure ceramic parts is often challenging due to the extremely high 
melting temperature of ceramics. Additionally, it’s challenging to get 
the designed scaffolds using direct 3D printing due to ceramics ’ 
shrinkage during sintering [140]. Nevertheless, various research groups 
continuously evaluate novel strategies to overcome these limitations 
with encouraging results while maintaining a sustainable manufacturing 
process [141–143]. 
Table 3 lists some selected examples of 3D printed metallic bio-
materials for bone tissue engineering to demonstrate 3DP techniques ’ 
diversity and direct writing 3DP compatible metallic biomaterials. The 
internal micro and nano-architecture of a cellular (porous) scaffold 
structure significantly affect its mechanical properties and in vitro/in 
vivo biological behaviors. Recent advances in bioprinting have enabled 
rapid and accurate production of cellular structures based on 3D CAD 
models. Since the unit cell geometry and dimensions can control the 
final product ’s mechanical performance, producing cellular structures 
with cortical and cancellous bone-equivalent stiffness and strength 
while maintaining the optimum cell adherence, proliferation, and dif-
ferentiation is a great scientific interest now. Fig. 9 depicts some unit 
cells and lattice structures used in 3DP for bone graft applications (see 
Table 4). 
This type of CAD-designed controlled porosity can be applied to all 
material classes with a careful selection of bioprinting methods and 
printing process parameters to tailor the mechanical and biological 
performance. Limmahakhun et al. [151] fabricated 3D cellular struc-
tures (octahedral, pillar octahedral, cubic, and truncated octahedral) 
with precisely controlled internal architectures for bone TE by using photopolymerizable polymer (VisiJet ®M3 Crystal) consisting of ure-
thane acrylate oligomers and ProJet ®3500SD (3D Systems, USA) 
equipment. The pore size was 40–550 μm, and high porosity of 74% has 
been achieved. Strut alignment of ±45•was reported to increase the 
adherence of murine pre-osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1). 
Additionally, post-processing and surface modifications methods are 
essential in creating much smoother surfaces than the as-built ones and 
removing the residuals, especially for powder-bed fusion 3DP tech-
niques, such as SLM and SLS. These kinds of treatments are also crucial 
to change the internal structure of the material. Yan et al. [152] man-
ufactured a gyroid triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice 
composed of Ti6Al4V alloy by using SLM. While the as-built lattices 
exhibited an out-of-equilibrium microstructure with very fine α’ 
martensitic laths, they showed a homogenous and equilibrium lamellar 
αβ microstructure with less dislocation and crystallographic defects 
after heat treatment at 1050 •C for 4 h followed by furnace cooling. The 
sandblasting of 3D printed parts was reported to remove metal particles 
successfully but created tiny cracks, which were later eliminated by 
hydrochloric acid (HCl) etching. Subsequent sodium hydroxide (NaOH) 
etching was reported to result in many small and shallow micro-pits and 
developed a sodium titanate hydrogel layer on the lattices ’ surfaces, 
improving bioactivity Ti alloy and deposition of HA in simulated body 
fluid (SBF). 
Bioprinting of CAD-designed hard-tissue structures customized to 
specific patient needs can allow the rapid production of large amounts of 
samples and improve routine clinical procedures for products that better 
meet regular surgical needs. However, commercial translation of 
advanced systems, such as cell-laden tissue constructs, needs tissue 
maturation by dynamic cell culture in bioreactors. Table 2

83.2. Osteochondral tissue engineering 
Cartilage defects are usually caused by trauma, illness, or aging. The 
defects disrupt the joints ’ biomechanical properties, affect the tissue ’s 
performance, and may result in disability. Most cartilage defects are 
often accompanied by osteochondral lesions involving both the hyaline 
cartilage in the joint and the underlying subchondral bone. It is desirable 
to provide simultaneous regeneration of the different layers of the 
osteochondral lesion. However, due to the different biological origins 
and chemical composition of cartilage and subchondral bone in osteo -
chondral injuries, treatment with existing clinical techniques, such as 
medication and surgical intervention, remains a major challenge. 
Knee cartilage treatment applications can be categorized as arthro -
scopic chondroplasty, autologous chondrocyte transplantation, osteo -
chondral graft transplantation, cell-based cartilage regeneration, 
implants, and microfracture application. These approaches may lead to 
total joint prosthesis surgery as the last stage intervention. Some of the 
current treatment options, including absorbable 3D scaffolds for carti-
lage regeneration, are depicted in Fig. 10. 
3DP methods are also prominent for osteochondral scaffold fabri-
cation due to their ability to produce interconnected porous scaffolds 
with well-controlled pore geometries as the scaffold structure can be 
designed to exhibit tissue-matched mechanical properties. Various 3DP 
techniques have been used for osteochondral tissue regeneration, 
including liquid, powder, and solid-based methods to create gradient scaffolds with various biomaterials, structural properties, and mechan -
ical properties [154]. 
Osteochondral tissue engineering requires more complex designed 
scaffolds than bone scaffolds. For example, articular cartilage is attached 
to the subchondral bone, and thus the osteochondral unit at the knee is 
formed. Therefore the natural structure is multi-layered and includes 
tissues with different characteristics. The complex, non-linear, visco -
elastic, anisotropic, and heterogeneous structure and composition of the 
cartilage make it necessary to produce scaffolds corresponding to this 
structure by innovative bio-fabrication methods biomaterials that can 
provide a biomimetic environment. Today, 3D printing and bioprinting 
strategies allow the fabrication of scaffolds and biological tissue sub-
stitutes that can accurately reflect the complex organizational structure 
and material properties of tissues and organs. In the table below, ex-
amples of multilayer and/or bi-phasic osteochondral tissue scaffolds 
created with 3D printing techniques are given. 
Barbeck et al. [158] combined the PLA layer and a biphasic PLA/ -
bioglass G5 layer for regeneration of osteochondral defects by using a 
nozzle-deposition system (direct-printing tool) (Tissue Engineering 
3-Dn-300, Sciperio/nScrypt Inc). The authors reported that the data 
obtained from both histological observations and histomorphometric 
measurements revealed the tissue responses to different layers of 
two-layered scaffolds are localized to the relevant implantation sites. Table 3

93.3. Skin tissue engineering 
The body ’s outermost layer is the integumentary system that consists 
of the skin and its appendages: hairs, nails, sweat, and sebaceous glands. 
The skin has many protective and regulatory functions, such as serving 
as a barrier to infectious organisms, resisting potential hazards from 
harmful substances, regulating body temperature, and acting as a sen-
sory interface with the environment. However, the skin is susceptible to 
a wide range of infections, damages, and illnesses like cancer as the 
outermost organ. 
The skin has an intricate design that varies in different parts of the 
body, but it is mainly composed of a highly vascular dermis covered by 
multiple layers of cells known as the epidermis. When the skin is injured 
or its integrity is broken for other reasons, organic residues should be 
removed, and the wound area should be supported by adding new 
components. These should include extracellular matrix and soluble 
factors to rebuilt cellular interactions. The autologous skin grafts are 
ideal wound closure materials used in acute and chronic wound de-
ficiencies with different etiologies. However, other solutions, such as 
bioengineering and synthetic alternatives, are necessary as skin grafts 
can lead to issues, such as additional health risks and deforming donor 
site morbidity, and unavailability of good healthy skin should also be 
considered. 
Tissue-engineered skin substitutes and other wound dressings are 
designed to replace or support the skin’s form and function permanently 
or temporarily until the integrity and function are recovered. An ideal 
skin substitute should not cause decreased sensitivity, scarring, skin 
discoloration. It should resist infections, prevent dehydration, and 
mimic the natural skin tissue ’s elasticity. 
Many production techniques, such as electrospinning, freeze-drying, 
and solvent casting, have long been used for skin substitute construc -
tions. Skin bioprinting has gained increasing attention due to its ability 
to provide sophisticated and controlled production that is impossible 
with traditional skin graft production methods. It is among the most 
rapidly developing biomedical applications of 3DP technologies. 
Vijayavenkataraman et al. [160] emphasized a tremendous demand 
for 3DP technology companies because there is a huge potential for 
immediate commercialization. They gave three examples from 2015: 1) L’Oreal USA collaborated with Organovo, Inc. to 3D bioprint skin tissue 
models for testing the cosmetic products. 2) Procter & Gamble (P&G) 
started a research project in Singapore to collaborate with biomaterial 
scientists and tissue engineers for developing skin models. 3) Rokit, the 
market leader in 3D printing technology in Korea, announced that their 
focus would be on the bioprinting of human skin tissue in a 
government-funded project. As 3DP technology in skin TE becomes 
widespread over time, similar examples are continually increasing. 
Patient-specific production is one of the essential advantages of 3DP 
technologies. For example, Albanna et al. [161] developed a mobile skin 
bioprinting system that provides rapid on-site management of extensive 
wounds (Fig. 11). The system ’s main components consist of a hand-held 
3D scanner and a printhead with eight 260 μm diameter nozzles, each 
driven by an independent dispensing motor that enables XYZ movement

The number of research studies on skin regeneration related to the 
use of both bottom-up and top-down 3DP technologies by the scientific 
community is far greater than the number of commercial products. The 
number of research articles on full-thickness skin models, which 
resemble natural human skin, has increased in the literature, especially Table 4

10in recent years. It has been shown that skin is one of the most suitable 
organs for restoration using 3DP technology in the medical field. Table 5 
summarizes some recent examples of 3DP manufacturing of skin tissue- 
engineered products. 
3.4. Cardiovascular tissue engineering 
Like standard product prototyping and fabrication with 3DP, car-
diovascular 3DP starts from a 3D model, which is then translated into a 
machine instructions-set to perform a layer-by-layer fabrication of the 
object (i.e., organ). The patient-specific organ ’s 3D model is often ob-
tained from medical imaging technologies that generate a volumetric 
imaging dataset. For instance, Computerized Tomography (CT) scans, 
volumetric 3D echocardiography, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), 
and 3D Trans-Esophageal Echocardiography (TEE) can all be used to 
obtain a full or partial patient organ 3D reconstruction [20]. Because of 
its high spatial resolution (sub-millimeter), CT has been the primary 
imaging methodology employed for high fidelity, patient-specific organ, 
and tissue imaging for 3D applications [41,42]. Following the image 
acquisition, the obtained results are usually segmented to distinguish 
various organ components, and last, the segmented images are 
re-rendered in 3D before conversion to “. stl” files. However, it is to note 
that although the obtained models can be used as-is for 3D printing, 
complex anatomical models often need extra final touches using CAD 
software, which might be the case in situations where the segmentation 
targeted complex vascular network or for device insertion adaptations 
(e.g., aortic stent simulation). 
3DP could also be used as a diagnostic tool for patients with struc-
tural heart disease [32]. Moreover, SLA has been used in-vivo and in-vitro 
to build patient-specific mitral valves from elastomeric polymers [39]. Recently, Ware et al. [64] used a modified DLP printer to fabricate 
patient-specific biodegradable aortic stents. 
Aortic aneurysm and dissections are considered major disease pro-
cesses affecting the aorta [38]. This disease is often associated with high 
morbidity and mortality worldwide. The aortic aneurysm is commonly 
located in the infrarenal abdominal aorta (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; 
AAA) and the ascending thoracic aorta (thoracic aortic aneurysm ). At the 
organ level, the aneurysm is characterized by a progressive weakening 
of the aortic wall inducing a local dilation (F50%) of the aorta [167, 
168]. Fig. 12 depicts the ascending aortic aneurysm occurring in the 
ascending portion of the thoracic aorta, a section of the artery close to 
the heart. 
Usually, thoracic aneurysms are treated by a composite aortic graft 
(Dacron Tube) implant. During the surgical procedure, the aorta ’s 
dilated portion is excised and replaced with a prosthetic Dacron tube 
graft. For the descending thoracic aneurysm, a less invasive approach is 
proposed. This procedure consists of using a transluminal placed endo-
vascular stent graft [169–171]. Briefly, the stents are made of two 
components, the metallic structure, which is fabricated from nitinol 
(nickel-titanium alloy), alloy steel, or 316L stainless steel metal; and the 
prosthetic conduit, which is made of polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or 
polyester fabric [171]. Both components are permanently attached 
before intra-arterial insertion. Although simple to accomplish, this 
procedure is not free from post-surgical complications. Ellozy et al. 
[170] revealed various challenges that have to be addressed to improve 
endovascular graft efficiency. Among these complications, 38% are 
device-related, including, but are not limited to, proximal and distal 
attachment failure, mechanical device failure, and periprocedural 
death. To reduce these device-related risks, new strategies for stent-graft 
engineering and fabrications must be elaborated.

Yilmaz et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioprinting 23 (2021) e00148
11To date, 3DP has been used in the cardiovascular field as a visuali -
zation and simulation tool. 3D printing has been used to produce high 
fidelity patient-customized aortic replicas for planning endovascular 
stenting in transverse aortic arch hypoplasia [24,36]. Moreover, given 
the current advances in the 3D bioprinting field demonstrated by intri-
cate vascular network prints [108], future aneurysm therapies might 
rely on one-demand patient-specific 3D-printed aorta stent [64]. 
Currently, the number of studies using 3D bioprinting techniques for 
vascular and valvular tissue engineering is still limited, but studies have 
been published indicating significant advances in this area. Koc et al. 3D 
bioprinted a macro-vascular tissue, such as the aorta, directly from the 
medical images with a bioprinting approach based not on scaffolds or 
cell-laden hydrogels [172]. Fig. 13 explains the roadmap of the pro-
duction of the scaffold-free tissue-engineered aorta. After the 
computer-aided algorithms were developed, mouse embryonic fibro-
blast (MEF) cell clusters and hydrogel support structures were 3D bioprinted according to the proposed self-supported method aortic tis-
sue structure. The proposed system can print various cell types such as 
smooth muscle, endothelial, and fibroblast cells. However, obtaining a 
sufficient amount of living cells is a challenge, and there is undoubtedly 
a need for optimized bio-ink preparation for each cell type. 
More recently, examples of similar studies in the cardiac field have 
also been published, with increasing interest in the bioprinting approach 
without scaffolds. To overcome the limitations of stem cell injection 
therapies for myocardial infarction treatment, tissue engineering aims to 
create stable cardiac tissues. The key criteria are the creation of con-
tractile cardiac tissue patches and the vascularization of implanted 
patches. Yeung et al. 3D bioprinted a biomaterial-free cardiac tissue and 
evaluated these cardiac patches ’ in vivo regenerative potential [188]. 
The patches were consisted of cellular spheroids created from coculture 
of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, 
fibroblasts, and endothelial cells at a ratio of 70:15:15. The bioprinting

a standard coordinate system (c). The scanned data with its coordinate system is used to generate the fill volume, and the path points for the nozzle head to travel to 
print the fill volume (d). Output code is then provided to the custom bioprinter control interface for the nozzle path generation to print fill volume (e,f). (E) This 
system facilitates the depositing of multiple cell types with high precision and control. The layering of fibroblasts (green) and keratinocytes (red) is shown.

12procedure was started with designing the single spheroid layer by using 
3D bioprinter software. The 3D bioprinter identified the spheroids ’ lo-
cations in 96-well plates and a robotic arm then used vacuum suction to 
pick up and transfer and load the cell aggregates individually onto a 
needle array in exact spatial coordinates to the 3D design. After bio-
printing, the cardiac patch was matured for 3 days in the needle array. 
After printing and culturing, the monolayered 350–400 μm thick cardiac 
patches were implanted into a rat myocardial infarction model 
(Fig. 14a). The echocardiography results demonstrated that there is an 
improvement in cardiac function. Cell retention within implanted 
patches at 4 weeks post-surgery (Fig. 14 (d-g)) was found to be much 
higher compared to studies in which more than 85% of cells were lost 
within 24 h after cell injection therapy. 
4.Conclusions & future outlook 
Current advances in 3DP technologies and new printing materials 
engineering have evolved 3DP beyond its initial place and role as a 
conceptual modeling tool. Today, 3DP has started finding unique and 
niche applications in a wide range of diverse sectors as a preferred end- 
product manufacturing technology. The simplicity, flexibility, and 
agility for complex manufacturing with 3DP have been a significant 
precursor in this interest boom. 
It is necessary to note and highlight the importance that the rise of 
3DP popularity has been tightly related to the improvement of printing 
materials, including biopolymers, thermoplastic polymers, ceramics, 
metals and composites, in conjunction with integrated innovations in 
controls, sensing, and automation fields. The biomedical field has undoubtedly benefited from 3DP technology and materials ’ evolution, 
as already seen with tissue engineering products, prosthetics, and 
implant manufacturing. Moreover, biocompatible materials and dedi-
cated printing devices (bioprinters) have allowed first full organ printing 
attempts. A challenge in obtaining successful full organ 3D printing Table 5

13resides in the complexity of the biological structure that constitutes the 
said organ. A physiological organ is often composed of an assortment of 
cells distributed in a given pattern. These cells are perfused with the 
bloodstream that regularly delivers oxygen and vital nutriment and 
carries CO2 and cellular waste to maintain viability. Accordingly, the 
challenging aspect of full organ bioprinting would be to print various 
cell types with intricate perfusion systems simultaneously. In addition, 
currently available bioreactors fail to satisfy the need for adequately 
simulating cellular conditions to expand large cell populations in vitro. 
One of the main challenges in today ’s bioprinting is bio-ink optimi -
zation. Obtaining materials that can be processed at high resolutions, 
preserving the viability of cells at high rates during and after the process, 
and creating the appropriate cellular environment to direct the desired 
cell behavior are the requirements that need to be addressed simulta -
neously. In dense polymers preferred for post-printing shape retention, important cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and 
ECM accumulation may be disrupted. While dense networks generally 
provide the best shape fidelity and 3D printability properties, it has been 
challenging to balance these advantages and disadvantages in terms of 
cell viability and function, especially for fragile and sensitive cell types 
such as pluripotent stem cells that can self-renew indefinitely or differ -
entiate into any cell in the body. Also, porosity, or porous microstructure 
created by bioinks, is important to allow diffusion of blood for cells to 
survive until neovascularization is completed. 
In addition to the innovations in bioinks, the conventional in vitro 
bioprinting, which relies on the implantation of pre-fabricated con-
structs, is needed to evolve into in situ bioprinting for tissues are to be 
fabricated or repaired directly on the intended anatomical location by 
using the patient ’s body as a bioreactor (Fig. 15). 
Even though there have been some attempts to in situ bioprint

multidisciplinary innovations are needed to create a simultaneous/

need to be strictly controlled utilizing integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in the future. Miniaturization and sterilization of bioprinters and

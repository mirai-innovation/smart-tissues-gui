Three ‐dimensional bioprinting shows great potential for autologous vascular grafts
due to its simplicity, accuracy, and flexibility. The 6 ‐mm‐diameter vascular grafts are
used in clinic. However, producing small ‐diameter vascular grafts are still an
enormous challenge. Normally, sacrificial hydrogels are used as temporary lumen
support to mold tubular structure which will affect the stability of the fabricated
structure. In this study, we have developed a new bioprinting approach to fabricatingsmall ‐diameter vessel using two ‐step crosslinking process. The ¼ lumen wall of
bioprinted gelatin mechacrylate (GelMA) flat structure was exposed to ultraviolet
(UV) light briefly for gaining certain strength, while ¾ lumen wall showed as concave
structure which remained uncrosslinked. Precrosslinked flat structure was merged
towards the uncrosslinked concave structure. Two individual structures were
combined tightly into an intact tubular structure after receiving more UV exposure
time. Complicated tubular structures were constructed by these method. Notably,the GelMA ‐based bioink loaded with smooth muscle cells are bioprinted to form the
outer layer of the tubular structure and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were
seeded onto the inner surface of the tubular structure. A bionic vascular vessel with
dual layers was fabricated successfully, and kept good viability and functionality.
This study may provide a novel idea for fabricating biomimetic vascular network orother more complicated organs.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are considered the major cause of
death world widely (Zoghbi et al., 2014 ). The main treatment
methods include medical therapy, endovascular intervention, andsurgical transplantation (Buchanan et al., 2014 ). Autologous blood
vascular transplantation remains to be the gold standard for surgical
transplantation (Rodriguez et al., 2016 ). Although surgical technique
continues to be improved, the success rate of autologous bloodvascular transplantation is only around 50% (de Vries et al., 2016 ).
The reason for failure is the embolization of vessels due to the
difference of diameter and mechanical properties between grafts andcardiovascular (Y. Zhang et al., 2017 ). Tissue ‐engineered vascular
grafts (TEVGs) have been explored as potential candidate for the
treatment of CVDs. TEVGs, larger than 6 mm, have been widely usedin cardiovascular surgery. However, due to the limitation of
manufacturing technology, the construction of small ‐diameter blood
vessels (SDBVs) grafts is still a challenge (Yamanaka et al., 2018 ).
Most of the vessels are composed of three concentric layers:
intima, media, and adventitia (Elliott & Gerecht, 2016 ; Nemeno ‐
Guanzon et al., 2012 ). Intima is the innermost layer of vessels, which
is consisted of a monolayer of endothe lial cells. It directly contacts the
blood and is a barrier to prevent blood infiltration and thrombosis. The
middle layer is composed of collagen I, c ollagen II, proteoglycan, elastin,
and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Smooth muscle and collagen arealigned in a spiral pattern which is conducive to maintaining the
elasticity and structural support. The adventitia is composed of
fibroblasts and a loose collagen structure, which can keep the vascularstructure intact and prevent tearing (Lesman et al., 2016 ;T o m a s i n a
et al., 2019 ). There are many methods for making TEVGs, including
electrospinning, phase separation, dissolution casting, and so on (Jinget al., 2015 ; Miller et al., 2012 ; Pattanaik et al., 2019 ;W a n ge ta l . , 2018 ).
Those processes simulate blood vessels mostly in mechanical properties,
which are still insufficien t in biological properties.
Three ‐dimensional (3D) bioprinting, a newly developed technol-
ogy that integrates digital modeling, electromechanical control,
information control, biomaterials, and chemistry, can accurately
locate the cells and biomaterials into the complex multiscale structureand simulate the complex tissue (Kolesky et al., 2016 ; Murphy &
Atala, 2014 ). In the past decade, 3D bioprinting has been widely used
in the field of vascular regenerative medicine (Hong et al., 2020 ;
Kolesky et al., 2014 ). Rotary bioprinting is a convenient method.
Fibrin ‐based vascular structures are fabricated through a new self ‐
designed rotary 3D bioprinter. During 2 months of the cultures,mechanical strength and collagen deposition are observed and theburst pressure of the structure reaches 52% of human saphenous
vein (Freeman et al., 2019 ). Yet, the structure constructed in this way
is relatively immature, which cannot meet the complexity of naturalvessels. A heterogeneous bilayer bionic blood vessels with 2 cm
length and 4 mm lumen diameter are bioprinted by vertical stacking
method in one step. The dense inner layer containing humanumbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the loose outer layer
containing SMCs are formed by using the two separateconcentrations of gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) in different layers
(Xu et al., 2020 ). The above research provides a theoretical possibility
for us to create small ‐diameter vessels. However, there is also an
obvious deficiency in this study. The construct is easy to collapse
during the printing process due to the gravity of hydrogels, thus thelength and inner diameter of vessels are limited. Therefore, a new
approach needs to be developed to overcome those shortcomings.
Sacrificial hydrogels, such as agaro s e ,g e l a t i n ,a n dp l u r o n i cF 1 2 7a r e
usually used to create complex tubular structure. Pluronic F127
containing HUVECs and Ca2+is used as the coaxial inner layer, and
catechol ‐functionalized, gelatin methac rylate (GelMA/C) containing
SMCs is used as the coaxial outer layer. The GelMA/C undergoes rapidoxidative crosslinking in situ when touching the Ca
2+during the printing
process and a vascular structure with high tissue affinity, perfusability,
and permeability is formed (Cui et al., 2019 ) .A g a r o s ei sa p p l i e da st h e
temporary support of the scaffold and various vascular cell types are
successfully self ‐assembled by a rapid prototyping bioprinting method
to form a vessel construct with controllable diameter (Norotteet al., 2009 ). Although sacrificial hydro gels can be used as a support
in the bioprinting process, each sacrifice hydrogel has its own
disadvantages. Agarose has a melting point of 60 –70°C which will lead
the cell destruction in the process of removal (Miller et al., 2012 ).
Gelatin has poor mechanical property and cannot fulfill the support of
complex structure. Due to good quality in printing and wonderful
support property, pluronic F127 is used commonly. However, theconcentration of pluronic F127 used in the bioprinting needs to reach
30% –40% which will lead the water moving out of the low
concentration bioink due to osmotic pressure. Thus, the accuracy ofthe structures and the cell viabilities will be affected (Wu et al., 2011 ).
We have developed a novel two ‐step crosslinking method for the
fabrication of bilayer small ‐diameter vascular vessels, which could avoid
the deficiency of sacrificial hydrogel and improve the accuracy of theprinting process. To achieve this p urpose, ¼ lumen wall of bioprinted
GelMA ‐based flat structure was bioprinted and underwent a short ‐time
UV light curing to obtain a certain str ength. Then, the flat structure can
be turned to cover the concave structure made by uncrosslinked GelMA
to build a tubular structure. The tubular structure was treated with long ‐
time UV curing to make sure that the two independent parts could becombined firmly in the format. First, we studied the properties of
GelMA bioink with different crossl inking time, and then evaluated the
connectivity of the two ‐step crosslinking structure. Furthermore, we
fabricated complex small ‐diameter vascular vessels with HUVECs and
SMCs by the two ‐step crosslinking method. To the best of our
knowledge, this study represents a new methodology for constructingcomplicated bionic vascular vessel.
2|MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 |Synthesis and identification of GelMA
The GelMA was synthesized by the following procedure (Xu
et al., 2020 ). The 8 g gelatin (type A, 300 bloom from porcine skin;1674 |
JIN ET AL.Sigma ‐Aldrich) was dissolved in 50 ml 0.25 M carbonate ‐
bicarbonate buffer with pH 9.2 for 1 h, and then 0.8 ml ofmethacrylic anhydride (MA) (Sigma ‐Aldrich) was slowly added into
the gelatin solution. The mixture was allowed to react for 3 h under
700 rpm stirring at 55°C. The reaction was terminated by theaddition of 80 ml Dulbecco's phosphate ‐buffered saline (DPBS),
and the resulting solution was dialyzed in deionized (DI) water with
12–14 kDa cutoff dialysis tubes at 37°C for 7 days. The DI water
was changed every 12 h. The solution was filtered and cooled at−20°C for 1 h, −80°C for 2 h, lyophilized for 5 days, and stored at
−20°C freezer until use.
2.2 |1H‐nuclear magnetic resonance analysis
GelMA was confirmed by1H‐nuclear magnetic resonance (1H‐NMR).
The 30 mg/ml GelMA was dissolved in deuterium oxide (D 2O)
(Sigma ‐Aldrich) at 40°C.1H‐NMR spectra were obtained by NMR
spectroscopy with a single axis gradient at 400 MHz (1H‐NMR;
Bruker). Gelatin was used as a control.
2.3 |Determination of 2,4,6 ‐
trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid
The methacrylation degree of GelMA was measured by 2,4,6 ‐
trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) (Sigma ‐Aldrich) assay. GelMA
was dissolved in sodium bicarbonate solution (pH = 8.5, 0.1 M) toobtain a concentration of 200 μg/ml. The 250 μl of 0.01% (wt/vol)
TNBS reaction solution was added to the sample solution and the
reaction lasted for 2 h at 37°C. The reaction was terminated with250μl 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 125 μl 1 N hydrochloric
acid (HCl). The 100 ml mixture was added into 96 ‐well plate
and optical density (OD) was obtained by microplate reader
(SpectraMax M5; Molecular) at 335 mm. Gelatin was used as a
control.
Degree of the methacrylation = (1 −OD of GelMA/OD of Gela-
tin) × 100 (%).
2.4 |Fourier ‐transform infrared spectroscopy
analysis
GelMA was dissolved in DPBS at a concentration of 50 mg/ml for 2 h
at 37°C. After GelMA was completely dissolved, 1 m/v 2 ‐hydroxy ‐4ʹ‐
(2‐hydroxyethoxy) −2‐methylpropiophenone (irgacure 2959; Sigma ‐
Aldrich) was added. The mixture was crosslinked for 5, 10, 20, 40, 60,
80, and 100 s with the wavelength of 365 mm and the intensity of200 mV/cm
2in the individual samples. The samples were lyophilized
and analyzed by Fourier ‐transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) ‐
attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy (Frontier; PerkinElmer). Allsamples were scanned five times at 400 –4000 cm
−1with a resolution
of 4 cm−1. Gelatin was used as a control.2.5 |Preparation sample of GelMA solutions
GelMA solutions consisted of 50 mg/ml GelMA, 30 mg/ml gelatin,
3.5 mg/ml sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid [HA]), 10% vol/vol
glycerol, and 1% m/v Irgacure 2959 in DPBS water. Gelatin andglycerol could increase the printability and HA could increase the
biocompatibility of GelMA hydrogel (Xu et al., 2020 ). The 500 µl
mixture was cast in a mold and crosslinked for 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80,and 100 s under the UV light with a wavelength of 365 nm and theintensity of 200 mV/cm
2to make a sample with 1.8 cm in diameter
and 2 mm in thickness in the individual samples.
2.6 |Rheological measurements
The mechanical properties of GelMA with different crosslinking times
were analyzed by using a discovery hybrid thermometer dhr ‐2 (TA
Instruments). Frequency scanning was performed from 1 to 100 Hzwith 1% constant strain. Strain scanning was performed from 0.01%
to 3% rad/s at an oscillation frequency of 1 Hz.
2.7 |Swelling ratio and residual mass test
GelMA samples with different crosslinking times were weighed as
(Wo) and gently shaken in DPBS and DI water at 37°C for 2 days to
remove the uncrosslinked GelMA. The swelling mass was recorded as
(Ws) and the expanded samples were lyophilized to obtain themass (Wr)
Swelling ratio = (Ws −Wr)/Wr × 100%,
Residual ratio = Wr/(500 × 5%) × 100%.
2.8 |Scanning electron microscopy
The samples were placed in DI water at 37°C for 2 days, cooled at
−80°C for 2 h, and then lyophilized. The cross section of the structure
was sputter coated with gold at 15 mA for 2 min (EM Ace600; Leica)and observed under a scanning electron microscope (SEM; Flex
SEM1000; Hitachi) at 10 kV. The diameters of different samples were
analyzed using Image J.
The 3D bionics vascular structure was fixed with 2.5% glutar-
aldehyde (Sigma ‐Aldrich) at 4°C for 4 h after 7 days of culture. The
structure was dehydrated with 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and100% ethanol for 20 min each. After replacing the ethanol with Co
2
by a critical point dryer (Leica; EM CPD 300) and coating with gold,
the samples were observed by SEM.
2.9 |Combination of two step crosslinking
GelMA solution was added to one side of the mold (Figure 3a). After
crosslinked for 10 s, the solution was added to the other side andJIN ET AL.
 |1675crosslinked for 100 s to form a two ‐step crosslinked sample. GelMA
solution was added to both sides of the mold and directly crosslinkedfor 100 s was used as one ‐step crosslinked sample as a control.
Two‐step crosslinked and one ‐step crosslinked samples were
loaded in Instron mechanical tester (Model 5533; Instron Corpora-tion), and tensile tests were conducted with a maximum value of 10 N
load cell.
Two ‐step crosslinked samples were observed by SEM to analyze
the pore size and the integrity of connections.
2.10 |Cell culture
HUVECs (Lonza) were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium 2
(EGM ‐2) (Lonza) and SMCs (Lonza) were cultured in SMC growth
medium 2 (Promocell). Both media were added with 1% vol/vol
penicillin and streptomycin and the cells were cultured at 37°C, 5%
CO 2, and 95% relative humidity. The EGM ‐2 and SMC growth
medium were mixed at 1:1 ratio for culturing the printed vascular
structure, and the mixed medium was changed every 2 days. HUVECs
and SMCs used in all experiments were in 4 –8 generations.
2.11 |3D bioprinting of vascular structure
3D bioprinting was conducted with a custom ‐made integrated tissue
and organ printing. In brief, the printer had a X‐,Y‐, and Z‐stage
controllers, a distributing pneumatic pressure control system foraccurately dispensing several materials within a single print. The
bioprinter sat in a closed chamber under control temperature and
humidity. It could deposit cell ‐laden hydrogels together with
synthetic polymers and overcome the limitations on the size, shape,and structural integrity of single hydrogel prints and create
customizable tissue.
For printing our constructs, we added 5% GelMA solution into the
syringe with the nozzle of 300 μm (Izumi). The flat structure and the
concave structure were printed with the pressure of 100 kPa and the
feed rate of 60 mm/min. We crosslinked the flat structure under UV lightfor 10 s to increase mechanical strength, then placed it on top of concave
structure, and this integrated structure was crosslinked for 100 s to make
the two individual structures combined unitedly (Figure 3e).
The 10 × 10
6SMCs were mixed into 5% GelMA solution, and then
the cell ‐landen GelMA was bioprinted to fabricate the bionic vascular
structure as described above. Before the seeding process, 50 μg/ml
fibronectin (Invitrogen) solution was injected into the channel of thetubular construct to improve cell adhesion. The HUVECs suspension
( 3 0×1 0
6cell/ml) was slowly injected into the lumen by 10 µl
mircropipet to ensure that the cell su spension fills the entire space of
the lumen. Then, the structures were incubated at 37°C for 2 h and
were flipped every 30 min to permit cell attachment on all sides of the
lumen. Nonadherent cells were gently removed out of the lumen andthe structures were washed with DPBS for three times to maintain the
patency of the lumen. A bionic sma ll blood vessel with a monolayer ofHUVECs and SMCs layer was completed after cultivation in the mixed
medium for 7 days. (Freeman et al., 2019 ).
2.12 |Cell viability and proliferation
The cell viability was assessed using a LIVE/DEAD and Viability/
cytotoxicity Kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, the vascular structure waswashed three times with DPBS, and then incubated at 0.5 μl/ml
Calcein AM and 2 μl/ml ethidium homodimer for 45 min. Laser
confocal microscopy (LSI; Leica) was used to observe the living and
dead cells in the structure. Six random views were selected toevaluate the cell viability using Image J.
Cell Counting Kit ‐8 (CCK ‐8; Sigma ‐Aldrich) was used to detect
the cell proliferation in the vascular structure. These vascularstructures were transferred into a 24 ‐well plate. The 900 μl fresh
medium and 100 μl CCK ‐8 solution were added. After incubated at
37°C for 3 h, 100 μl solution was transferred into 96 ‐well plate and
the ODs were read by spectramax M5 at 460 nm.
2.13 |Histological and immunofluorescence
analysis
The vascular structures were fixed with 4% vol/vol para-
formaldehyde after culture for 7 days and cut into 15 μm section
with a cryostat (CM1950; Leica) at −20°C. Slices were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome methods.Images were collected by light microscopy (DM4000b; Leica).
For immunofluorescence staining , HUVECs were labeled with mouse
anti‐human CD31 (1:50; Abcam) and SMCs were labeled with rabbit anti ‐
human α‐s m o o t hm u s c l ea c t i n( α‐SMA) (1:200; Abcam). Alexa Fluor 488
goat anti ‐mouse (1:500; Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey anti ‐rabbit
(1:500; Abcam) were used as secondary antibodies. All the sections were
counterstained with 4 ′,6‐diamidino ‐2‐phenylindole. Fluorescence images
were obtained with a fluorescent microscope (Leica; DM8000). The
sections without primary antibody staining were used as control.
2.14 |Statistical analysis
Data were processed by calculating means ± standard deviation.
T‐test was used to assess the differences between groups. p< 0.05
means significant difference (* p< 0.05; ** p< 0.01; *** p< 0.001; NS,
not significant)
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Synthesis and identification of GelMA
The amino groups on gelatin were partly replaced by methacrylic acid
to form GelMA with crosslinking ability (Bahcecioglu et al., 2019 ). The1676 |
JIN ET AL.synthetic GelMA was identified by1H‐NMR (Figure S1). The
characteristic resonance peak of the methacrylic acid group(5.5–6 ppm) appeared in GelMA, which is missing in the control.
The substitution degree of GelMA was assessed to be 79.3% ± 2.7%
by TNBS (Figure 1).
3.2 |The effect of crosslinking time on GelMA
properties
The number of double bonds in GelMA increased with increasing
crosslinking time (Chen et al., 2012 ) (Figure 2a). Treated with
different crosslinking time, GelMA showed different physical states.
While the GelMA with only 5 s crosslinking time was changed from
liquid to preliminary solid, which cannot maintain its shape for alonger time. However, samples with 10, 20, and 40 s crosslinking time
maintained good shape (Figure 2b) lasting for a longer time.
FTIR was used to identify the correlation peaks in GelMA with
different crosslinking times. A peak at 1525 cm
−1corresponded to
C–N stretching and N –H bending; 1640 cm−1to O –H bonding;
2922 cm−1to C –H stretching; and 3300 cm−1to O –H stretching.
GelMA with different crosslinking times showed different peaks atthese positions (Dursun Usal et al., 2019 ). We evaluated the FTIR of
gelatin, uncrosslinked GelMA, and GelMA with different crosslinking
times. The peaks of the two amino groups at 1540 and 1640 cm
−1in
uncrosslinked GelMA were significantly increased compare with
gelatin, which indicated that the amino groups in gelatin were
successfully replaced by methacrylic acid. After UV irradiation fordifferent times, the two peaks gradually decreased. In addition, the
–OH stretching vibrations at 3300 cm
−1also decreased, which was
related to the decrease of total –OH caused by UV curing (Figure 2c).GelMA with different crosslinking time was shaken in DI water at
37°C for 2 days. The uncrosslinked GelMA was removed, and theremaining GelMA in the structure expanded which led to the pore
size increasing (Figure 2d). The average pore sizes were
292.2 ± 25.00 (5 s), 308.9 ± 23.53 (10 s), 175.8 ± 15.66 (20 s),85.06 ± 8.977 (40 s), and 82.07 ± 9.089 (100 s) (Figure 2e). Gelatin,
glycerin, and HA contained in crosslinked GelMA bioink will not
affect the pore sizes of the constructs (Figure S2).
To characterize the physical properties of GelMA bioink with
different crosslinking times, oscill atory rheological measurements were
used. The storage modulus (G ʹ) and viscosity coefficient of GelMA bioink
increased with the crosslinking time, while it kept steady when thecrosslinking time reached 40 s (Figure 2f,g). In a certain range, the storage
modulus remained stable with changing of frequencies and strains, which
indicated the structure of crosslinked GelMA was stable under the shearforce (Figure 2h,i). In addition, the storage modulus of GelMA bioink at
each crosslinking time was much greater than the loss modulus which
i n d i c a t e dt h a tc r o s s l i n k e dG e l M Aw a si nas o l i ds t a t e( F i g u r e 2j).
GelMA bioink with different crosslinking times showed different
swelling ratios in DPBS and DI water. GelMA's swelling ratio was
23 times in DPBS with 5 and 10 s crosslinking times. With increasingof crosslinking time, the swelling ratio decreased. The swelling ratiowas 17.5 times with 20 s crosslinking time, and it was 15 times with
40 s at which point it stabilized (Figure 2k). The swelling ratio was
more remarkable in DI water. The swelling ratio was 400 times in 5and 10 s, 200 times with 20 s, and closed to 100 times with 40 s
(Figure 2l). This trend indicated that an increased number of double
bonds result in a more stable framework.
The residual mass indicated the amount of residual GelMA in
structure. With the increased of crosslinking time, residual mass
increased gradually. The average residual masses obtained were

(80 s), and 88.49% ± 1.58% (100 s) (Figure 2m).
3.3 |Combination of two ‐step crosslinking
approach
Two‐step crosslinking resulted in substantial cohesion. Figure 3a
showed that 10 s precrosslinked GelMA can be recrosslinked with the
uncrosslinked GelMA bioink and for med a united combination. There
was no sign of splitting at the combining site under the SEM observation(Figure 3b). In tensile loading, there was no significant difference in
Young's modulus and tensile strain between structures formed by one ‐
step and two ‐step crosslinking methods ( p> 0.05) (Figure 3c–e).
3.4 |Fabrication of complicated tubular structures
We used the two ‐step crosslinking approach to fabricating a tubular
structure of GelMA. The method of two ‐step crosslinking toconstruct tubular structure was showed in Figure 3f. Figure 3g
showed the tubular construct with different diameters (0.08 –0.2 mm
in lumen diameter and 0.6 mm in wall thickness). A 6 mm long tubularconstruct was showed in Figure 3h. SEM showed that the tubular
structure has good bonding properties (Figure 3i).
Complicated designs demonstrated the advantages of two ‐step
crosslinking method. We printed multiple curved tubular structure,
branched tubular structure, circular tubular structure with single
inlet/outlet, and several letters (Figure 4). Red inks were injected into
these structures to show the connected channels within each
structure and to demonstrate their integrity of fluid flow.
3.5 |Cellular vessel structures
The GelMA mixed with SMCs was used as the bioink for building
vascular wall, while HUVECs were perfused into the inner vascular
cavity to form a bionic barrier between the blood flow and
vascular wall.
The viabilities of SMCs and HUVECs in the vascular structure
were analyzed by live/dead staining. The fluorescence images of 1, 4,

granular state at the first day after printing. On the fourth day, thenumber of cells began to increase, and some cells began to expand in
their shape. Most cells expanded and SMCs showed the long spindle
shape in 7 days (Figure 5a). The cell survival rates were 93.64 ± 1.455
(Day 1), 91.62 ± 2.070 (Day 4), and 95.62 ± 1.312 (Day 7). All the
survival rates in the structures were more than 90% (Figure 5b). CCK ‐

(Figure 5c). Cells significantly proliferated in the vascular structures.
H&E and Masson's trichrome staining were used for morpho-
logical detection, and immunofluorescence was used for functional
assessment. After 1 week of culture, spreading out SMCs were well
distributed in the outer layer. HUVECs formed a monolayer cellcoverage on the inner lumen surface (Figure 5d,e). CD31 and
α‐SMA immunofluorescence confirmed an inner endothelial layerand the outer smooth muscle layer from the vascular structure
(Figure 6a).
The morphology of the outer, middle, and inner layers of GelMA
vascular construct were further observed by SEM. Interestingly, the
SMCs in the outer layer and middle layer were spreading out andarranged linearly along the vertical direction of printing. The HUVECs
in the inner layers attached tightly to the GelMA lumen surface and
expanded to form a tight barrier evenly (Figure 6b).
4|DISCUSSION
Scientists have been rapidly developing tissue ‐engineered artificial
blood vessels in the past decade, and used multiple ways to construct
them (Morin et al., 2013 ). 3D bioprinting has become a research
hotspot because of precision spatial control and uniform cell
distribution (Hong et al., 2020 ). 3D bioprinting is a rapid prototyping

design aspects such as imaging, modeling, printer selection, bioinkselection, culture conditions, and 3D structure (Murphy &
Atala, 2014 ; Y. S. Zhang et al., 2018 ). However, there are still
difficulties in the fabrication of complicated SDBVs. The medicalapplication of 3D printing technology is still limited, especially due to
that available bioinks are not suitable for the most targeted
applications. Printable materials with good biocompatibility tend tohave poor mechanical properties. During the printing process, the
collapse of structure due to gravity is one of the common causes that
lead to fabrication failure (Ozbolat & Hospodiuk, 2016 ).
Normally, sacrificial hydrogels offer a temporary support in the
fabrication of small ‐diameter vessels. But all sacrificial hydrogels have
disadvantages (Bertassoni et al., 2014 ; Tocchio et al., 2015 ). There-
fore, we developed a two ‐step crosslinking method to fabricate
tunable structures. This method avoids the use of sacrificial hydrogels
and produces a vessel structure with using single photocurable
hydrogel —GelMA without using sacrificial hydrogels.
Hydrogel, as a material for loading cells and supporting
structures, is particularly important in 3D bioprinting (Hoelzl
et al., 2016 ). An ideal hydrogel needs to have biological and
mechanical properties close to its intended tissue and should be
adaptable to the printing process. In addition, hydrogel structuresneed to facilitate cell proliferation and differentiation after bioprint-
ing. Naturally derived hydrogels, including agarose, alginate, collagen,fibrin, gelatin, and HA, provide an effective growth environment for
cells (Cui et al., 2017 ). However, these hydrogels lack sufficient
mechanical strength to create the complicated 3D tubular structure.GelMA as a biocompatible polymer is produced by modified gelatin
with MA, and is able to be crosslinked with UV light to obtain higher
physical strength (Liu & Chan ‐Park, 2010 ). Our preliminary experi-
ments showed that crosslinked GelMA hydrogel can be stacked up to
20 printed layers. In this study, 5% (m/v) GelMA was used to
fabricate the tubular structure. The pore size at this concentrationcould hold SMCs in the spot of 3D space, and was beneficial to the
proliferation of the cells (Jeong et al., 2007 ). We compared the
properties of GelMA solution with different curing time. AlthoughGelMA with 5 s crosslinking time could get semisolid immediately, itcould not keep its shape for a longer time. The MA group in GelMA
will open continuously and form connectivity during the extension of
crosslinking time. The storage modulus, viscosity coefficient, andresidual mass of GelMA will be increased, while the expansion radio
will be decreased due to the process of crosslinking. With the
crosslinking agent that we used in the study, 5% GelMA can achievecomplete crosslinked state basically under 40 s UV light with a
wavelength of 365 nm and the intensity of 200 mV/cm

JIN ET AL.remains in a stable state with the extension of crosslinking time. The
10 s crosslinking time for GelMA was chosen at the first crosslinkingstep to ensure the stability of the transfer structure, open the leastdouble bonds, and then lay a proper foundation for the second
crosslinking step. In our results, two independent structures can be
well connected with the 10 s as the first crosslinking step. Thecomparison of the structures fabricated by one ‐step and two ‐step
method indicates that there is no obvious difference in micro-
structure and mechanical properties. Moreover, the water absorptioncapacity of GelMA with 5 s and 10 s crosslinking time could reach
400 times of its own mass in DI water, and its volume also expandsaccordingly. Therefore, the low degree of crosslinked GelMA was
also a good swelling material to be applied in the research field oftissue engineering.
Precrosslinking can enhance the physical property of photocur-
able hydrogel. In the process of vertical bioprinting, the printed
bottom GelMA bioink was partly crosslinked by continuous UV lightto avoid cell leakage and structure collapse (Xu et al., 2020 ). A user ‐
defined, complexity cell ‐laden channel was fabricated by a sequential
printing approach. The photocurable hydrogels were briefly exposedlayer ‐by‐layer to increase support performance. The sacrificial
hydrogels were printed into the desired layer and fully crosslinked.

 |1681With the removal of sacrificial hydrogels, precise and complex
channels could be constructed (Ji et al., 2019 ). In our study, GelMA
was made semisolid after first ‐step crosslinking process. The
semisolid GelMA with required physical strength could be bonded
tightly with uncrosslinked GelMA. The combination was receivedsecond ‐step crosslinking process which produced a longer UV
exposure time. A bionic vascular vessel with small diameter was
built successfully with using the two ‐step crosslinking method, which
maintains consecutive tubular structure. The cross ‐section of printed
tubular structure was quadrate. In our subsequent investigation, we
will assemble two semicircle structures into a circular tubular
structure by this method and construct bionic blood vessels thatare more in line with vascular anatomy and dynamics.Furthermore, this method might be not only suitable for vessels,
but also for other complicated structures, such as hepatic sinusoid,nephron, and pulmonary alveoli. The hydrogel can be partly cured,
and the two ‐step curing can integrate two independent parts into a
whole. The two ‐step crosslinking method may be suitable to
photocurable hydrogel with better mechanical properties and makestructures that are difficult to be formed by one ‐step crosslinking
method. In addition, different kinds of photocuring materials
containing double bonds may also be used with this two ‐step
crosslinking method. In this way, we could make the connection
between different tissues in bioprinting, such as the superior vena
cava bioprinted by one photocuring material connects with the heartwhich is bioprinted by another photocuring material.

JIN ET AL.Human blood vascular vessel have three distinct layers: intima
(endothelial cells), media (SMCs), and externa (fibroblasts) (Tomasinaet al., 2019 ). We created a small ‐diameter vascular structure ( Ø<6m m )
with the spatial distribution of two different cells, which include
bioprinted SMCs within bioink and subsequent perfusion of HUVECsinto the lumen space. SMCs could aggregate, spread out, and proliferate
to form outer layer of the construct, and rich collagen area was found in
that area. Perfused HUVECs formed the connected inner layer thatcovers entire intralumenal surface with dense junctions. The SMCs werelined longitudinally along the structure which may be caused by axial
traction during printing. During the culture of bioprinted vessel
structure, the previous inner square shape turned to smooth gradually,that has been reported in previously publication (Esch et al., 2011 ).
Through this two ‐step crosslinking method, we have successfully
bioprinted multiple complicated tubular structures and bionicsvessels with inner monolayer endothelium surrounded by outer layer
SMCs. This new fabrication method for tissue engineering of small ‐
diameter vessel might be applied in developing small blood vessel forclinical application. In addition, two ‐step crosslinking method could
be adopted to create more complex structures that are implantable
and functional for the alternative therapies.
5|CONCLUSION
We proposed a new approach to making small ‐diameter vessels with
complicated patterns and spatial cell distribution. The two ‐step cross-
linking method created a continuous connection between differentprinted parts and resulted an intact tubular structure with biological and
mechanical advantages. We accomplished this method through the
investigation of GelMA properties altered by crosslinking time and
optimized by crosslinking process. We fabricated a small vessel thatpossesses printed outer layer of SMCs and perfused inner layer of
HUVECs by using GelMA bioink and two ‐step crosslinking method. We
also observed that the SMCs and HUVECs were proliferated, andfunctionalized during postprinting culture. Our study might provide a
new fabrication method for the construction of small ‐diameter vessel
with clinically relevant size and characteristics.

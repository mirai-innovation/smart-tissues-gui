Abstract
3D bioprinting is a promising new tissue restoration technique that enables the precise deposition 
of cells and growth factors in order to more closely mimic the structure and function of native 
organs. In this study, we report the development of a new bioink using oligo(poly(ethylene 
glycol) fumarate) (OPF), a photo-crosslinkable and biodegradable polymer, for 3D bioprinting. 
In addition to OPF, a small portion of gelatin was also incorporated into the bioink with to 
make it bio-printable. After immersion in the cell medium, gelatin was eluted away to create a 
bioprinted scaffold of pure OPF. Excellent cell viability, spreading, and long-term proliferation 
of encapsulated cells was observed using both bone and nerve cells as examples. These results 
demonstrate that OPF bioink has great potential in future 3D bioprinting applications that aim to 
replicate complex, layered tissues and/or organs.

1. Introduction
The 3D printing of biological materials, commonly named 3D bioprinting, provides a 
promising substitute for future tissue and organ restoration by combining engineering 
techniques and biological principles into one system.1–3 The biggest advantage of 3D 
bioprinting is that it allows biomaterials, cells, growth factors, and other bioactive cues 
to be precisely deposited in three-dimensional space, allowing for the close replication 
of the complex architecture that is commonly found in native organs.4–6 Due to this 
advantage, 3D bioprinting has gained extensive attention from many fields including 
biomedical engineering, tissue engineering, organ engineering, regenerative medicine, 
and cancer treatment.7–14 With intensified research efforts, 3D bioprinting has received 
rapid technological development in instruments, biological inks, crosslinking methods, and 
printing models in recent years.3,15–18

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe most widely used 3D bioprinting modalities are inkjet bioprinting/droplet bioprinting, 
laser-assisted bioprinting, and extrusion-based bioprinting.19–22 However, regardless of the 
technique used, the technical bottleneck in these bioprinting systems is not due to the 
printing technology itself but instead lies in the ideal formulation of bioink materials.23,24 
An ideal bioink should combine numerous properties together into one formulation. These 
properties include but are not limited to, 1) a favorable viscosity to prevent blocking the 
print head, 2) a quick shear recovery rate to facilitate the immediate cessation of flow upon 
deposition, 3) the ability to form covalent or ionic bonds among polymer chains (crosslink) 
to maintain a printed shape after deposition, 4) good biocompatibility to maintain viable 
cells, and 5) biodegradability to leave all space for tissue/organ formation.25–29
Hydrogels, which are thoroughly hydrated polymers, proteins, or peptide networks that 
able to retain large quantities of water,30,31 are one of the most favorable biomaterials 
used for 3D bioprinting.16 Various natural or synthetic polymer was tried as bioinks 
for tissue engineering, including alginate-based gels, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) gels, 
and poly(ethylene glycol (PEG) gels.27 Oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) is a 
biocompatible polymer made up of hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains adorned 
with double bonds that, when irradiated with ultraviolet radiation (UV), open and crosslink 
with each other to form a soft hydrogel.32,33 The resulting crosslinked OPF hydrogel 
is biodegradable in situ  through the hydrolysis of ester bonds,34 while also displaying 
impressive biocompatibility in both in vitro  and in vivo  studies investigating bone and nerve 
tissue regeneration.35–38
In this study, we report the development of an OPF-based bioink for tissue engineering (Fig. 
1a). The bioink consisted of a crosslinkable OPF polymer with a small portion of gelatin. 
Prior to bioprinting, cells were first encapsulated within a sterilized OPF/gelatin solution, 
resulting in a cell/ink slurry. This slurry was then quickly cooled to obtain a viscous bioink 
gel taking advantage of the sol-gel transition of gelatin chains formed within the bioink 
(Fig. 1b). The bioink was then printed using a gas-assisted extrusion bioprinter to form 
the desired shape, inducing polymer crosslinking through UV light exposure to form a 
stabilized hydrogel with cells encapsulated within (Fig. 1c). The bioprinted scaffold was 
finally washed with pre-warmed cell culture medium to dissolve and elute the gelatin portion 
(Fig. 1c).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Polymer Synthesis
OPF was synthesized in accordance with our previous reports.39–41 In brief, 100 g of PEG 
with a nominal number average molecular weight ( Mn) of 10,000 g mol−1 was added into a 
three-neck flask purged with nitrogen gas. Then 800 mL CH 2Cl2 (dichloromethane, DCM) 
solvent was added and stirred for 30 min to allow the full dissolution of the PEG polymer. 
Excess K 2CO3 (40 g) was added as a proton scavenger for the following reaction (Fig. 2a). 
The flask with PEG/DCM/K 2CO3 was then placed into an ice bath and 1.1 mL of fumaryl 
chloride was added dropwise. The system was kept stirring at a 50°C for 24 hours under 
reflux. To remove unreacted K 2CO3 particles, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL 
falcon tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and Liu et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptthe synthesized OPF polymer was precipitated in diethyl ether and dried overnight under 
vacuum. The structure of synthesized OPF was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) using deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3) as the solvent.
2.2 Bioink Evaluation
Crosslinkability, gelation, and printability.— A series of inks with varied OPF 
concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt% and gelatin percentages of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9, 10 wt% relative to the α-Minimum Essential Medium ( α-MEM) volume were 
fabricated. The crosslinkability of bioinks was checked after UV irradiation for 2 minutes. 
After immersing in deionized (DI) water overnight, the gels that maintained a cohesive 
shape were marked as good. Others that had big cracks or broken into large pieces after a 
soak in water overnight were marked as fair. Bioinks that broken into many small pieces in 
water were marked poor crosslinkability.
The gelation ability of bioink formulations after kept stable on table for 24 hours (~18–20 
°C) was examined using the tube inversion method, as referred to previous reports.42 After 
inversion, the bioinks that created full and homogeneous gels were recorded as good. The 
ones with at least half gel formation were recorded as fair. Those with less than half gel 
formations were recorded as poor gelation.
The printability of these inks using a 0.25 mm diameter print head on a Bio-X 
bioprinter (CELLINK, Gothenburg, Sweden) under a pressure range of 1–100 kPa was 
also investigated and recorded. The goal shape of scaffolds is 10 mm × 10 mm width and 
length, and 1 layer of 0.25 mm thickness, with 25% infill density. The bioinks that could be 
printed into uniform and continuous shapes were recorded as good. The bioinks that could 
be printed to shapes, however, unperfect or non-uniform, were recorded as fair. All other 
situations where the inks formed non-continuous or incomplete shapes were recorded as 
poor.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM).— Hydrogel samples were all dried by 
lyophilization for 3 days. Dried samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1 min to 
freeze the structure and then broken open using forceps. The exposed broken surfaces 
were sputter-coated with gold-palladium and examined on a scanning electron microscope 
(S-4700, Hitachi Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) at 5 kV voltage.
Cytotoxicity of leaching medium.— To evaluate whether the bioinks could release 
cytotoxic substances to the surrounding cells, the crosslinked hydrogel specimens were 
placed into transwell chambers (mesh size 3 μm). MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells were 
seeded into six-well TCPS plates seeded at a density of 15,000 cells per well and cultured 
using α-MEM media supplemented with 0.5% streptomycin/penicillin and 10% fetal bovine 
serum. Cells were placed in a 37 °C cell culture hood for 6 hours to allow attachment to 
the bottom of the plate. Then the transwell chambers with hydrogel specimens were inserted 
into the six-well plates and the plates were placed back into 37 °C cell culture hood. Wells 
without sample treatment was used as a positive control. At 1, 3, and 7 days co-culture, 
the cell density in each well was determined with the MTS assay (CellTiter 96, Promega, 
Madison, WI), reading absorbance on a UV-vis absorbance microplate reader (SpectraMax Liu et al. Page 3
J Biomed Mater Res A . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptPlus 384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at a wavelength of 490 nm. Cell viability in 
each well was calculated by normalizing absorbance to that of the positive control wells (set 
as 100%).
2.3 Bioprinting
Gel preparation.— To prepare the gelated formulation, 15 wt% of OPF polymer and 
5 wt% gelatin were added to 1 mL of α-MEM, with 30 μL of polyethylene glycol 
diacrylate (PEGDA, Mn ~ 570 g/mol) added as a crosslinker, and 2.5 mg of Irgacure 2959 
(Sigma-Aldrich Co., Milwaukee, WI) added as photo-initiator. The mixture was then kept 
at 60°C for 30 min while protected from light to allow the full dissolution of OPF polymer 
and gelatin. The dissolved mixture was then sterilized by filtering through a 0.45 μm 
sterile syringe filter (Whatman, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA), as previously 
reported.43 The filtered stock solution was kept at 4°C for 1 hour to allow gelation and 
subsequently stored at 4°C before usage.
Cell collection.— MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells for bioprinting were first expanded in big 
150 × 25 mm tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using α-MEM 
supplemented with 0.5% streptomycin/penicillin and 10% fetal bovine serum. After reaching 
~ 80% confluency, the cells were trypsinized and counted. Cell suspensions with desired cell 
numbers were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was removed gently 
to collect cells.
Bioink preparation.— To prepare bioink, the gelled mixture was taken out of the 4°C 
fridge and re-liquidized in a 37°C water bath. The melted gel was then added with the 
collected cells and gently mixed under sterile conditions. The cell/gel mixture was then 
placed on ice for 1 min to obtain the gelled bioink.
Bioprinting and crosslinking.— The bioink with encapsulated cells was printed using 
a 0.25 mm diameter print head on a Bio-X bioprinter (CELLINK, Gothenburg, Sweden). 
Following bioprinting, scaffolds were immediately exposed to UV light for 2 min to allow 
crosslinking. The crosslinked, bioprinted scaffolds were washed with prewarmed 37°C α-
MEM three times, and immersed in excess α-MEM and cultured in a 37°C cell culture 
incubator.
2.5. Immediate Cell Viability after Bioprinting
To investigate the immediate cell viability after bioprinting, MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells 
were bioprinted at a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL of bioink. Immediately after bioprinting, 
gels were cross-linked through UV exposure for 2 minutes and cells were stained using 
the LIVE/DEAD® Cell Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The live 
cells (green) and dead cells (red) embedded within the bioprinted scaffolds were viewed 
using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 780, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The 
morphological properties of the printed scaffolds were observed using an Axiovert 25 Zeiss 
light microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).Liu et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.6 Bone Cell Proliferation
To investigate the long-term cell viability and proliferation in the bioprinted hydrogel, 
MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells were bioprinted at a density of 10 × 106 cells/mL of bioink. 
The shape of the scaffolds printed is 10 mm × 10 mm width and length, and 1 layer 
of 0.1 mm thickness. After bioprinting, scaffolds were immediately exposed to UV light 
for 2 min for photo-crosslinking. Scaffolds with cells encapsulated within were washed 
3 times with excess pre-warmed α-MEM to dissolve and wash away the gelatin coils. 
The cell/scaffold constructs were then cultured in α-MEM at 37°C. At 1, 4, and 7 days 
post-seeding, the constructs were stained with LIVE/DEAD® Cell Imaging Kit and viewed 
with an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope as described above. The MC3T3 pre-
osteoblast cell densities proliferated in the bioinks were determined using the MTS assay 
(CellTiter 96, Promega, Madison, WI). The optical absorbances were read on a UV-vis 
absorbance microplate reader (SpectraMax Plus 384, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) 
with wavelength at 490 nm. Average values and statistical analyses were calculated on four 
independent tests.
2.7 Nerve Cell Proliferation
PC12 neuronal cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 
expanded in big 150 × 25 mm tissue culture dishes using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle 
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, and 0.5% 
streptomycin/penicillin, and incubated at 37 °C with a 95% relative humidity and 5% 
CO2. After reaching 80% confluency, PC12 cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 3000 
rpm for 10 min and mixed into bioink at a density of 10 × 106 cells/mL using the same 
procedure as described in the MC3T3 cell mixing section. After bioprinting, scaffolds were 
immediately exposed to UV light for 2 min for photocrosslinking. Crosslinked scaffolds 
were then washed 3 times with excess pre-warmed DMEM to elute the gelatin coils and 
the cell/scaffold constructs were cultured in DMEM in a 37 °C incubator. After 1, 4, and 
7 days of culture, the constructs were stained with LIVE/DEAD® Cell Imaging Kit and 
viewed with an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope as described above. The PC12 
cell densities proliferated in the bioinks were determined using the MTS assay and read on 
a UV-vis absorbance microplate reader at 490 nm, as described above. Average values and 
statistical analyses were calculated on four independent tests.
2.8 Statistical analysis
The statistical difference among varied experimental groups was analyzed using a one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOV A) with post hoc Tukey HSD test when necessary. Any two data 
groups with p-value calculated lower than 0.05 were marked with a significant difference.
3. Results
3.1 Bioprinting Setup and Bioink Screen
OPF was successfully synthesized and the structure was confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) using deuterated chloroform (CDCl 3) as solvent (Fig. 2a–b). To determine 
the bioprintability and cell viabilities in printed scaffolds, MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells were Liu et al. Page 5
J Biomed Mater Res A . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcollected by centrifugation and mixed with OPF/Gelatin slurry (1 × 106 cells/mL) to make 
bioinks, as presented in Fig. 3a. The bioinks were then printed using a CELLINK Bio-X 
printer setup (Fig. 3b) followed by UV crosslinking for 2 min.
For bioinks to be useful in tissue engineering applications, the crosslinkability, gelation 
ability, and printability of the bioink formulations must be optimized to meet the challenges 
of 3D printing as well as in vivo  implantation. In order to screen the best bioink, we 
fabricated a series of inks with varied OPF concentrations and gelatin percentages. As 
demonstrated in Fig. 3c, the crosslinking ability of inks was enhanced by the addition 
of OPF but inhibited by the presence of gelatin. A higher OPF concentration aided in 
the crosslinking process, while a higher gelatin concentration interfered with successful 
crosslinking, particularly when the gelatin portion was higher than 6% and the OPF 
concentration was lower than 10%.
In addition to crosslinking ability, the gelation capability of a bioink is also critical. Gelation 
in OPF/Gelatin originated from the formation of coils among gelatin polymer chains. As can 
be noted in Fig. 3d, better gelation observed as the gelatin percentage increased. When OPF 
is 5% in the formulation, good gelation was observed with the addition of ≥ 2% gelatin. 
When OPF increased to 10 and 15%, good gelation was observed with ≥ 4% gelatin. When 
OPF increased to 20 and 25%, gelation was observed only with higher gelatin fractions of ≥ 
7% or even 9%.
The printability of the bioinks was also investigated. Results showed that printability is 
closely related to gelation. For inks with less than 3% gelatin, gelation was not successfully 
achieved and the ink was similar to free-fluid, leading to poor printability. For inks 
with more than 3% gelatin, gelation occurred and the inks were able to be printed 
into different shapes by adjusting the printing parameters (Fig. 3e). However, inks with 
extremely high gelatin concentration (9–10%) yet low OPF content (5–10%), the printability 
performance was also inadequate. This result may be due to the high stiffness of inks at high 
concentrations of gelatin, preventing effective and continuous extrusion of the material from 
the printing head (Fig. 3e). Based on these results, a bioink with 15 wt% OPF and 5 wt% 
gelatin was selected for further bioprinting analysis.
Cell viability within gels was determined immediately after bioprinting and crosslinking 
using LIVE/DEAD staining. Live and dead cells were counted and the proportion of each 
was obtained by dividing by total cell number. For bioinks with weak crosslinkability or 
printability, the obtained shapes were not perfect and cells were counted from the imperfect 
pieces. As shown in Fig. 3f, when OPF content is as high as 20–25% in the bioink, cell 
viability dropped drastically. However, bioinks with OPF content lower than 15% showed 
most of the cells were alive with only a small portion of dead cells likely caused by the 
extrusion pressure. An enlarged view of the live/dead cell imaging in 15% OPF and 5% 
gelatin showed potential live cells within the bioink (Fig. 3g). These results indicate that cell 
viability is closely related to the ratio of components within the ink. This result is consistent 
with previous reports that display robust cell viabilities using hydrogels as bioinks.44–46Liu et al. Page 6
J Biomed Mater Res A . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript3.2 Bioprinted scaffold properties
Based on the above bioink screen results, the bioink with 15 wt% OPF and 5 wt% gelatin 
in cell medium has the favorable crosslinking ability, gelation, printability, and relatively 
high cell viability, thus was selected for bioprinting of scaffolds. Various infill densities 
could be achieved by adjusting the printing parameters, with example photographs shown 
in Fig. 4a. Bioprinted scaffolds were examined under a microscope to determine the shape 
integrity and continuity, as well as cell distribution. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, scaffolds 
showed homogeneous ridges and cross-sections. Cells were also observed to distribute 
homogeneously across the scaffolds, as noted from the enlarged view of these scaffolds (Fig. 
4c).
In addition to rectangular scaffolds, bioinks can also be printed into round shapes with 
circular edges. A typical photograph of the bioprinted round scaffolds was presented in 
Fig. 4d. The microscopic images showed that round scaffolds also had homogeneous cell 
distribution and shape integrity and continuity, even at the edges (Fig. 4e).
To evaluate the properties of the bioink, crosslinked OPF ink before and after washing were 
fabricated into round shaped disks for gel properties evaluation. After lyophilization, the 
micro-structures within the hydrogel were observed by SEM. As presented in Fig. 5a–b, 
gels after washing showed porous structures within the hydrogel as compared with gels 
before washing. This indicates that the gelatin can be washed away and leave microporous 
structures within the gel. To evaluate whether the crosslinked OPF bioink gel produces 
byproducts that are cytotoxic to the surrounding cells, hydrogels were placed into transwells 
and cocultured with MC3T3 cells for 1, 3, and 7 days. As shown in Fig. 5c, no significant 
cytotoxicity was observed for the bioink after coculturing with cells.
3.3 Bioprinting and proliferation of bone cells
The cell viability and densities of MC3T3 pre-osteoblast cells in bioprinted scaffolds were 
investigated after culturing for 1, 4 and 7 days. As observed by confocal imaging in Fig. 
6a, the bioprinted cells were homogeneously distributed within the bioprinted scaffolds and 
showed a round shape after 1-day in culture. After 4 days, cell growth was observed to start 
on the edge of the bioscaffolds, which may be because cells at these locations were exposed 
to an abundance of oxygen and nutrients (Fig. 6b). After 7 days of culture, cell growth was 
observed on the edge of the bioscaffolds as well as within bioscaffolds (Fig. 6c).
A specific analysis of typical cell morphologies was further conducted. At day 1, cells 
showed mainly round shape with limited filament outgrowth, as depicted by the schematic 
demonstration of each cell (Fig. 6d). However, after 4 days of culture, cells in the bioprinted 
scaffolds showed elongated shape with filament outgrowth (Fig. 6e). An enlarged view of 
typical cells showed clear filament outgrowth, as illustrated in the schematic demonstration. 
After 7 days of culture, a large population of cells was observed and cells were directly in 
contact with one another, indicating that intercellular interactions were achieved between 
encapsulated cells (Fig. 6f). These results indicate that bioprinted scaffolds could allow 
nutrient penetration and support good cell growth within the scaffolds. The MC3T3 pre-
osteoblast cells were quantified to be mostly alive in the scaffolds, as shown in Fig. 6g. Liu et al. Page 7
J Biomed Mater Res A . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe proliferation study showed significant cell growth after 7 days of culture (Fig. 6h). This 
observation is consistent with other reports describing cell proliferation during 1 week of 
culture after bioprinting.47
3.4 Bioprinting and proliferation of nerve cells
In addition to pre-osteoblasts, the viability and growth of PC12 nerve cells were also 
investigated. As presented in Fig. 7a, PC12 cells showed excellent viability within the 
bioprinted scaffolds after 1, 4 and 7 days’ culture. Similar to MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts, PC12 
cells also showed round-shaped morphology at day 1 of culture (Fig. 7a–b), indicating 
that OPF bioink was also biocompatible with PC12 nerve cells. After 4 and 7 days 
of culture, proliferated cell groups were observed by confocal imaging (Fig. 7c–f). 3D 
reconstruction of confocal images taken at randomly chosen areas in the bioink showed that 
the cells proliferated both at the edges and within the bioprinted scaffolds (Fig. 7c–f). The 
PC12 nerve cells were also determined to be mostly alive in the scaffolds (Fig. 7g). The 
proliferation of cells was also observed, with significantly larger numbers of cells after 4 and 
7 days of culture (Fig. 7h). These results demonstrated that OPF bioink could support the 
excellent proliferation of PC12 nerve cells.
Discussions
OPF based hydrogels have received significant attention due to their use as cellular scaffolds 
for cartilage, bone, and nerve tissue regeneration applications.33,35,37,48 A versatile system, 
the presence of reactive fumarate double bonds makes OPF cross-linkable using either a 
chemical or photo-crosslinking strategy, while the frequent ester bond repeats throughout the 
network facilitate non-toxic biodegradation. Several studies have successfully demonstrated 
that crosslinked OPF hydrogels are able to encapsulate the cells with minimal effect on their 
metabolic activities.48,49 Furthermore, with certain biological cues, the encapsulated cells 
have been shown to differentiate into the desired phenotype.50 These findings motivated 
the current study wherein 3-D bioprinted OPF hydrogels with encapsulated-cells have 
been developed. Here, we have proposed OPF-Gelatin as a bioink for further bioprinting 
applications.
Bioprinting techniques enable the spatial patterning of cells and other biological factors 
within the polymer matrix,51 improving the timely and precise development of the 
functional tissues. Hydrogel-based bioinks display a number of attractive properties that 
support this application, motivating the development of a number printable hydrogels that 
incorporate biological and synthetic compounds including gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), 
polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), alginate, collagen, hyaluronic acid (HA), chitosan, 
Pluronic, fibrin/fibrinogen, silk, agarose, and blends of these materials.27,28,52,53 Extrusion 
based bioprinting is one of the most commonly applied printing technique. It provides 
superior control over the cell deposition and distribution.51 One of the well-acknowledged 
limitations of extrusion-bioprinting is the high possibility of cell apoptosis due to the 
pressure exerted on the cells during extrusion through micro-nozzle. To ameliorate this 
concern, the optimization of bioprinting parameters including material amount, applied 
pressure, and temperature is vital for successful extrusion-bioprinting.54Liu et al. Page 8
J Biomed Mater Res A . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 March 23.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIn this study, we successfully demonstrated OPF hydrogels can be developed into a bioink 
for extrusion-based 3-D bioprinting. In its native form, the viscosity of the OPF solution 
does not support extrusion-based printing. However, through the addition of a gelatin 
fraction that doubles as a porogen after hydrogel crosslinking, our results show that OPF 
bioinks can support uniform extrusion when the gelatin content is optimized. The gelatin 
was added into OPF bioink formulations for two disparate reasons. First, during the 
bioprinting process, the OPF itself is not bioprintable without the addition of high viscous 
components. The inclusion of gelatin provides favorable rheological properties to the bioink, 
facilitating the extrusion of the ink and the structural integrity of the printed structure (Fig. 
1a). Second, after a 3D structure has been printed, gelatin can be eluted away through 
immersion in warm cell medium, leaving porous structures within the hydrogel. These two 
steps are based on the reversible gelation nature of the gelatin chains (Fig. 1b). The gelatin 
solution exists as a liquid form at 37 °C but can transform into a soft viscous gel at a gelling 
temperature (T Gel, close to room temperature ~21 °C) or even below.55,56 This transition 
is realized by the formation of coil-helix with intermolecular bonds. This unique material 
property is reversible when temperatures are increased above the T Gel threshold, resulting in 
the destruction of gelatin coils solubilization of the gel network.
At gelatin concentrations higher than 9% or lower than 3%, impaired printing was observed. 
Our overall optimization work on gelation and extrusion showed that the bioink with 15 wt% 
OPF and 5% gelatin was well suited for the printing. Furthermore, this composition was 
found to support the viability of encapsulated MC3T3-E1 and PC12 cells. The encapsulated 
cells not only maintained excellent viability but also showed a good proliferation over 
a seven-day period. The porosity created by the eroding gelatin enabled the rapid and 
continuous diffusion of nutrients into the hydrogel which might have contributed to the 
excellent cell response. Furthermore, gelatin itself has cell-binding sites which can positively 
influence the cell attachment and proliferation.57 Future studies will be focused on exploring 
more on printing multiple cell types and incorporating suitable biological cues for functional 
bone and nerve tissue regeneration.
Conclusions
In summary, we developed a ‘micro-structured’ hydrogel bioink with a network of pores 
designed to enhance the flux of oxygen and nutrients to encapsulated cells. Using 
a crosslinkable, biodegradable OPF polymer as the polymer backbone and gelatin as 
a porogen, a series of bioinks with various compositions were fabricated, and their 
crosslinkability, gelation ability, and printability were evaluated. Following bioprinting, 
scaffolds were washed with cell culture medium to remove gelatin from the crosslinked 
network and to create void volumes within the material. The OPF bioink formulations 
comprised of 15 wt% OPF and 5 wt% gelatin were found to display superior printability, 
gelation, and crosslinkability and were selected for evaluation using MC3T3 pre-osteoblast 
cells. Live/dead cell staining showed that the cells had good viability after bioprinting, while 
an excellent proliferation of cells was observed after culturing the bioprinted scaffolds in the 
medium for one week. In addition to pre-osteoblasts, PC12 nerve cells were also bioprinted 
and showed excellent cell proliferation within the scaffolds. These results demonstrate that Liu et al. Page 9

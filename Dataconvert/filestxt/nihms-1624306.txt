Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptCell survival during the early stages of transplantation and before new blood vessels formation is a 
major challenge in translational applications of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted tissues. 
Supplementing oxygen (O 2) to transplanted cells via an O 2 generating source such as calcium 
peroxide (CPO) is an attractive approach to ensure cell viability. Calcium peroxide also produces 
calcium hydroxide which reduces the viscosity of bioinks, which is a limiting factor for 
bioprinting. Therefore, adapting this solution into 3D bioprinting is of significant challenge. In this 
study, we developed a gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) bioink that was optimized in terms of pH and 
viscosity. The improved rheological properties led to the production of a robust bioink suitable for 
3D bioprinting and controlled O 2 release. In addition, we characterized O 2 release, bioprinting 
conditions and mechanical performance of hydrogels having different CPO concentrations. As a 
proof of concept study, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes were bioprinted using GelMA bioink 
containing CPO. Viability and metabolic activity of printed cells were checked after seven days of 
culture under hypoxic condition. The results showed that the addition of CPO improves the 
metabolic activity and viability of cells in bioprinted constructs under hypoxic condition.

1. INTRODUCTION
Cell-based therapy has shown potential for tissue regeneration, but many attempts have 
failed to show the repopulation of damaged tissue due to poor survival of the transplanted 
cells [ 1, 2]. A major limitation for successful cell therapy can be attributed to hypoxia due to 
vascular injury [ 3]. For transplanted cells to survive, there should be sufficient nutrients and 
oxygen (O 2) supply. Cells can rely on diffusion of O 2 to a limited distance of ~ 200 microns 
[4]. Several days to weeks are needed for angiogenesis to develop in vivo  [5], and during 
this critical time, most of transplanted cells will die while having no alternative supply of 
O2. Thus, by providing O 2 to transplants, cells may survive through this critical period after 
delivery [ 6], leading to improved regeneration capacity. Furthermore, in conditions such as 
myocardial infarction (MI), loss of cardiomyocytes occurs due to the lack of blood supply. 
In such situation, externally delivered O 2 may also help vulnerable endogenous 
cardiomyocytes to withstand the harsh post-MI hypoxic conditions [ 7]. It was found that O 2 
release is associated with increased angiogenesis in the heart in post-MI period in rats, 
which is probably due to enhanced survival of endothelial cells [ 8].
Recently, O 2 generating biomaterials have gained attention. Various O 2 materials have been 
explored as source of O 2, including sodium percarbonate ((Na 2CO3)2.3H2O2) [9], calcium 
peroxide (CPO) [ 10], magnesium peroxide and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) [8, 11]. Among 
these sources, CPO was found to be one of the best peroxides to provide prolonged O 2 
release, without needing encapsulation, and it has been thus used more frequently in O 2 
generating biomaterials [ 6]. CPO dissociates first to H 2O2 and Ca(OH) 2, which increases the 
pH in the O 2 generating biomaterial. Then, H 2O2 is converted to water and O 2. Oxygen 
release kinetics from peroxide compounds is influenced by different factors such as 
temperature [ 12], pH [ 13], and the use of catalase [ 13, 14]. To reduce the risk of the Erdem et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptgeneration of hydroxyl free radicals, a catalase is being used in the preparation of O 2 
releasing biomaterials. The use of higher concentrations of O 2 can be toxic to cells [ 15]. 
Alemdar et al.  tested CPO with cardiomyocyte-laden gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) discs 
(prepared by using two glass slides) in vitro,  and they found that cells survival and 
proliferation were enhanced for over five days [ 16, 17].
Three-dimensional bioprinting has been increasingly recognized as an advanced technology 
that can address many problems seen with conventional methods of tissue engineering, 
especially engineered tissue survival, integration and angiogenesis [ 18]. It is known that 3D 
bioprinting can be used for producing personalized therapeutic patches by using patient 
specific biologics. Robust 3D bioprinted constructs can further be used with the use of 
minimally invasive procedures [ 19, 20]. In a combinatorial approach, cell and an O 2 source-
containing bioinks can be used to fabricate patches using 3D bioprinting. It was therefore, 
envisioned that developing such an approach can help loaded cells and possibly 
compromised cells in the injured area, which can be of great benefit in future. GelMA has 
been investigated extensively for various tissue bioprinting applications, and it was found to 
enhance cellular adhesion [ 21, 22], and it was selected as bioink biomaterial of choice in our 
study. It is hypothesized that by supplying O 2 in the bioink, cell survival and function during 
and after the process of bioprinting can be improved which can also be reflected on the 
subsequent function of the resulting 3D printed constructs.
In this study, O 2 releasing 3D bioprinted constructs were developed by the addition of CPO 
as an O 2 source to the GelMA bioinks. One of the important parameters that should be 
considered in extrusion-based 3D bioprinting is the viscosity of the bioinks. It is known that 
viscosity affects both printing quality and processing as well as cell viability. We discovered 
that using CPO in 3D bioprinting demands a trade-off between amount of CPO being used, 
pH of the solution, and viscosity of bioink. The use of CPO as an O 2 source leads to the 
release of Ca(OH) 2 ions which affects the viscosity of bioink by the changing pH. The 
elimination of CPO side effect in the bioink composition was achieved using a buffer 
solution. Therefore, O 2 releasing bioink reported in the current study may change the 
paradigm in engineering and application of tissue constructs in 3D modelling and for 
regenerative therapy.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gelatin (Type A, 300 bloom from porcine skin), methacrylic anhydride (MA), calcium 
peroxide (CPO), catalase (obtained from bovine liver, 2000 – 5000 units mg−1 protein), 2-
hydroxy-4’-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methyl propiophenone (photoinitiator, PI), phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) and Alizarin red S were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, 
USA). Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), trypsin-EDTA, and penicillin
−streptomycin were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Alpha-modified Eagle’s medium 
(Gibco 11965–092, Invitrogen Co., USA was supplied by Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY , 
USA). FBS and precleaned microscope slides were obtained from Fisher Scientific 
(Waltham, MA, USA). The live/dead viability/cytotoxicity kit was obtained from Invitrogen 
(Grand Island, NY , USA). All reagents were used without further purification.Erdem et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.1. Gelatin Methacryloyl (GelMA) Synthesis
GelMA synthesis was performed using an earlier described technique [ 23]. Briefly, 10 g of 
porcine skin gelatin was completely dissolved at 60 °C in 100 mL of PBS for 60 min. Then, 
8 mL of MA was added drop by drop to the gelatin mixture and permitted to react at 50 °C 
for 3 h. The blend was mixed with double volume of distilled water to prevent the reaction. 
The GelMA solution was dialyzed with 12–14 kDa dialysis tube for one week against 
distilled water. Then, the dialyzed product was freeze-dried and preserved for further use at 
−80 °C.
2.2. Preparation of the O 2 Releasing Bioink
For the preparation of O 2 releasing bioink (CPO containing GelMA solution), three different 
stock solutions were prepared. In the first place, 10 mg of PI was dissolved in 1 mL of 0.1M 
HEPES buffer solution in order to gain a solid content with 1% (w/v) concentration. Then, 
200 mg GelMA foam was added to this solution to get 20% (w/v) GelMA stock solution. 
For the 2% CPO stock solution, 48 °L hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%) was added to 1mL of 
0.1 M HEPES, before the addition of 20mg CPO. These two stock solutions were used with 
third stock solution (0.1 M HEPES) with different ratios to obtain 10% GelMA, 0.5% PI and 
different CPO containing oxygenated bioinks (Table 1).
2.3. Three-Dimensional Bioprinting
Four bioink groups were produced, containing 10% GelMA with 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% 
CPO (Fig. 1A). In addition, 5 × 106 mL−1 of 3T3 fibroblast (NIH 3T3) cells (ATCC, 
Manassas, Virginia, USA) or 8 × 106 mL−1 of rat derived cardiomyocytes were added into 
bioinks. For cardiomyocyte isolation and suspension, we used a protocol published by our 
team earlier [ 24]. In brief, the heart of 1–2 day old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles 
River, USA) was isolated and suspended in Ca2+,Mg2+ free Hank’s balanced salt solution 
(HBSS, Gibco). The aorta and vena cava sections were then removed from the hearts. 
Subsequently, the hearts were cut into quarters and rinsed twice in cold HBSS. The heart 
pieces were then digested in a solution of 0.06% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in HBSS 
overnight (4°C). The tissues were then digested in collagenase II (200 U mL−1, Worthington 
Biochemical Corp., USA) in HBSS (37°C) in five supplementary digestions of 4–8 min. 
Following digestion, cells were pre-plated for 45 min and non-adherent cells were collected 
for use as the rat cardiomyocyte population. Rat cardiomyocytes were cultured in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) containing glucose (4.5 g L−1), 10% (v/v) 
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 1% (v/v) HEPES (100 U mL−1, Gibco), and 1% (v/v) 
penicillin-streptomycin (100 mg mL−1, Gibco).
A commercial 3D bioprinter (Cellink BioX 3D BioPrinter, Cellink AB, Gothenburg, 
Sweden) was used to print constructs, employing 23G needle, 80 kPa pressure, 20 mm s−1 
speed, while the substrate temperature was kept at 4 °C. Before printing, the 3D bioprinter 
chamber was sterilized using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation for 10 min. After printing, printed 
constructs were moved into UV chamber to crosslink by applying UV irradiation (Omnicure 
S2000, Excelitas Technologies, Salem, MA, USA) with 4 W cm−2 intensity for 40 s [ 25]. 
Light irradiation was applied at a distance of 8 cm from samples. Printability of each bioink Erdem et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscripttype was evaluated according to the filament spreading ratio, which was calculated by 
dividing the width of the printed filament by the needle diameter (23G needle: 337 μm) [ 26].
2.4. Characterization of Morphology and Morphological Changes
2.4.1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)— The microstructure of 3D printed 
GelMA hydrogels having different CPO concentrations was characterized by using scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini column Zeiss Supra 40VP Field Emission Scanning 
Electron Microscope). To prepare samples for SEM, hydrogels without cells were UV cross-
linked, kept in −80 ºC for 3 h, freeze-dried overnight and iridium coated. Microstructure and 
porosity of the hydrogels were analysed using the nearest distances plugin from ImageJ 
software and SEM images which were recorded using the SEM equipment. Also, energy 
disperse X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to determine different element in the 
hydrogels .
2.4.2 Swelling of O 2 releasing bioinks— For each bioink type, the swelling ratio of 
three samples (8mm diameter and 1.5mm thickness) was determined. Acellular hydrogels 
were weighed and placed into DPBS solution and kept at 37 °C for 24h. The weight of 
swollen hydrogels was defined after removing excess water from the surface. The swelling 
ratio of hydrogels was calculated according to the formula: ( Wt – W0)/W0; where, Wt and 
W0 represent the weight values of fully swollen and blot-dried hydrogels, respectively.
2.5 Mechanical Characterisation
2.5.1 Rheological behaviour— Rheological studies were performed using MCR-302 
rheometer (Anton Paar Ltd., Graz, Austria) with a 25 mm diameter parallel plate geometry 
with a gap distance of 0.5 mm, for bioinks, and an 8 mm diameter parallel plate geometry 
with a gap distance of 1.0 mm for hydrogels. A solvent trap was used to prevent 
dehydration. The temperature dependence of G’ and G” was obtained using temperature 
sweep (oscillation) by decreasing the temperature from 24 °C to 4 °C at a cooling rate of 1 
°C min−1. Then, the viscosity of bioinks was recorded at 4 °C from 0.1 to 100 shear rate.
2.5.2. Semi-Quantification of Bioink Printability— Printing quantification was 
performed following the procedure described by Liliang et al. [27], who introduced 
printability parameter (Pr), intended to quantify similarity with the nature of square-formed 
prints. This calculation was based on the circularity of enclosed area which is defined as C= 
4πAL−2 in where L is perimeter and A represents area. The highest circularity is at the C = 
1 condition. When the C value is closer to the 1, the shape is close to the circle. The 
circularity for squared shapes is equal to α/4 rather than circles and the Pr defined as Pr= πC
−1/4 = L2A−1/16. According to this equation, for an optimal printability, obtained Pr must be 
1, when the connected channel forms a complete square shape at ideal viscosity of bioink. 
While higher Pr is obtained with the higher viscosity, the lower Pr is obtained with lower 
viscosity. In the Image-J program, optical images of printed constructs were analyzed in 
order to determine the perimeter and region of the interconnected channels to calculate the 
Pr of each printed construct (n= 3).Erdem et al. Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.5.3 Compression— The mechanical properties of O 2 releasing hydrogels were tested 
using unconfined compressive test. The bioinks having different CPO concentrations were 
casted in PDMS molds (8mm diameter and 1 mm height) and exposed to the UV light (4 W 
cm−2) for 40 s for crosslinking. The compression strength of hydrogels was evaluated at a 
cross speed of 0.5 mm s−1 and up to 60% strain, using a mechanical testing machine (Instron 
Model 5542, Norwood, MA, USA). The Young’s modulus was determined based on the 
slope of the initial linear region, corresponding to 10% strain.
2.6. Oxygen Release Kinetics
To determine O 2 release kinetics from the hydrogels, samples having varying CPO content 
were separately placed in wells of a 12-well plate, each containing 1.5mL media and 
catalase (100 u mL−1). Released O 2 in the media was measured using O 2-sensitive electrode 
(World Precision Instruments, ISO-OXY meter, TBR 1025 free-radical analyser, Sarasota, 
Fl, USA) while having hydrogels under hypoxic condition (1% O 2, 5% CO 2 and 94% N 2 
incubator at 37 °C). Oxygen release was monitored daily for seven days.
2.7. Biological Assessment
To investigate the effect of having O 2 in 3D bioprinted constructs, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts-laden 
were used in bioinks having CPO in different concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 1% and 
cultured for 7 days in hypoxic conditions.
2.7.1. In vitro cell culture— Fibroblasts were cultured in T175 flasks with Dulbecco’s 
modified eagle’s medium containing 10% bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin 
(Pen Strep, Pen Strep 15140, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Trypsin (0.5%) was 
used to remove adherent cells from the surface of Petri dish. During the experiments, 100 u 
mL−1 catalase was added into the media (1.5 mL per well) while performing the 
experiments. Cell-laden CPO-GelMA bioinks were incubated in either normoxic (21% O 2, 
5% CO 2 and 74% N 2) or hypoxic (1% O 2, 5% CO 2 and 94% N 2) condition for seven days.
2.7.2. Cell viability— To further understand the effect of O 2 release, live/dead assay 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was performed for NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and 
cardiomyocytes in the 3D printed constructs having CPO microparticles in different 
concentrations and incubated under hypoxic condition. Constructs having no CPO 
microparticles and constructs kept in normoxic condition were used as controls. Before 
adding live/dead reagents, constructs were washed three times with DPBS. Live/ dead 
reagents were added to wells as 0.5 °L calcein AM and 2 °L ethidium homodimer in 1 mL 
PBS and incubated for 30 min. After 30 min, the reagent was removed, followed by washing 
the constructs thoroughly with DPBS. Finally, fresh DPBS was added to the constructs to 
observe the fluorescence emitted by the cells upon excitation of cells at two wavelengths of 
494 nm and 528 nm using florescent microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer, Walpole, MA). Live 
and dead cells were identified according to the color of the stains with red indicates dead and 
green live cells. We used ImageJ software for stained cell quantification in three different 
representative sections of each sample.Erdem et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.7.3. Cell metabolic activity in oxygen releasing bioink— The effect of O 2 on 
cellular metabolic activity was measured using colorimetric cell counting kit (CCK-8 assay, 
Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA). Briefly, 3D printed constructs 
containing 5×106 3T3 cells mL−1 or 8×106 cardiomyocytes mL−1 were cultured in 12 well-
plates for 7 days in DMEM with bovine serum and Pen Strep as supplements under hypoxic 
condition. Three-dimensional constructs were washed with DPBS for three times after each 
time intervals. Then, 10% CCK-8 reagent in plain medium was added to 3D constructs and 
incubated for 2h at 37 °C, and changes in color of media from pink to violet were noted. 
Subsequently, 100 μL of media in each well was transferred into 96 well plates and the 
absorption of media at 450 nm was measured using the microplate reader (Synergy™ HTX 
Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, BioTek Winooski, Vermont, USA).
2.8. Statistics
Statistical variations were evaluated using one-way ANOV A in OriginPro software. 
Bonferroni post-hoc test was used as a comparison test to determine whether there were 
significant differences. Differences were considered to be statistically significant whenever p 
was < 0.05, and < 0.01. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) was calculated from 5 
replicates of experiments.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Physical Properties of Bioprinted Constructs
In the current study, high degree of functionalization of GelMA (high methacrylated gelatin) 
was used for the preparation O 2 releasing bioink. Different degrees of methacrylation in 
GelMA (low, medium, high and very high) can be used in the preparation of bioinks. We did 
not use very high GelMA, because modification rate decreases the viscosity of bioinks 
which affects adversely printability [ 28]. In addition, the presence of CPO can negatively 
affect the photopolymerization of the bioink. Because of these reasons, we did not consider 
low and medium GelMA in our study. O 2 releasing bioinks were produced using 10% 
GelMA, containing CPO in varying concentrations (w/v) of 0.1% (0.1 CPO), 0.5% (0.5 
CPO), 1% (1.0 CPO), or 0% (0 CPO) with HEPES-HCl buffer, according to the protocol 
presented in Table 1 [ 29]. CPO has a basic pH characteristic; hence, its addition leads to 
increased pH. To avoid any harmful effect of basic environment, HEPES-HCl buffer was 
used to adjust pH to 7.0, 7.8 and 8.2 for 0.1, 0.5 and 1% CPO groups of bioinks, 
respectively, according to the Newland et al. [29] (Fig. S1). It should be noted that low pH 
will enhance O 2 release by increasing H 2O2 generation rate; accordingly, any excess amount 
of HCl, that can decrease the pH to lower than 5, should be avoided. It is worth mentioning 
that the pH values of prepared bioinks were in the range of 6.5–8.5, which are not harmful to 
cells considering the short printing time (30 min). After printing, constructs were incubated 
in DMEM cell culture media having pH value of 7.4, which subsequently stabilizes the pH 
of constructs.
Bioinks were prepared and printed at 4 °C. The effect of CPO on the physical properties of 
bioinks was evaluated via studying microscopic images of printed constructs, and changes in 
the spreading ratio of printed fibers were investigated (Fig. 2). The rheological properties Erdem et al. Page 7
Adv Healthc Mater . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 August 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript(viscosity measurements) corresponding to different changes in temperature and shear rates 
were also determined (Fig. 2B). The lowest spreading ratios were obtained from bioinks 
having 0.5 CPO, as it can be seen in Fig. 2A. This can be explained by the effect of reaching 
highest viscosity of GelMA bioink at its iso-electric point of 7.8 [ 30] (Fig. S2). When CPO 
is added, pH goes up and viscosity increases until reaching the iso-electric point of the 
GelMA. After passing this point, the viscosity of GelMA goes down. It was noted that 
bioinks with 0.5% CPO corresponds to the iso-electric point of GelMA. However, with 
increasing the CPO concentration to 1.0%, the viscosity goes down while pH continues to 
rise. Accordingly, 0.5 CPO has shown highest viscosity and resulted in the formation of 
thinner printed fibers (Fig. 2Bi), and on the other hand, 1.0% CPO ink was associated with 
lowest viscosity and resulted in the formation of the highest spreading fibers (Fig. 2Bi).
Figure 2Bii shows the relationship between bioink viscosity and changes in temperature. It is 
seen that viscosity significantly decreases with increasing temperatures up to ~20 °C, after 
which it does not tend to change in the studied range up to 25 °C. Fig. 2Biii shows how the 
viscosity of bioinks changes with the increasing shear rates. As discussed above, the 
viscosity significantly affects the printability (Pr) of hydrogels [ 27]. When the Pr value is 
close to 1, it shows that bioink can be easily printed. It was found that 0.5 CPO is associated 
with the highest viscosity, with 0.97±0.01 Pr value which is the closest value to the 1 and 
accordingly better printing quality and 1 CPO was associated with the lowest viscosity 
values and with 0.84±0.03 Pr values, which are the farthest from Pr value of 1.
3.2. Morphological Changes and Swelling of 3D Printed O 2 Releasing Constructs
Porosity is one of the most significant characteristics of a biomaterial that needed to be 
evaluated as it is linked to its swellability. The results of SEM studies that were performed to 
monitor the effect of incorporated CPO on the morphology and porosity of constructs are 
shown in Fig. 3. With increased concentration of CPO in the constructs, pore size was 
increased, which is probably due to released O 2. Furthermore, UV irradiation can be 
hindered by CPO, and this may result in weaker crosslinking and larger pore size (Fig. 3A). 
EDX analysis was performed to evaluate the percentage of contained elements (Fig. 3B and 
S4) and CPO particle dispersion in the printed constructs. As it is seen, with increasing 
CPO, peaks related to calcium and chloride become larger corresponding to the release 
Ca(OH) 2 and the addition of HCl, respectively.
The effect of CPO on the swelling ratio of O 2 releasing bioinks is presented in Fig. 3C. High 
O2 amounts released from 0.5 CPO bioinks indirectly affect the swelling ratio of constructs 
by inhibiting the photo crosslinking, leading to higher swelling ratios [ 22, 31]. The swelling 
ratio of O 2 releasing hydrogels was measured as 10.38 ± 0.29, 11.36± 0.39, 13.68 ± 0.74 and 
12.39± 0.64, for 0 CPO, 0.1 CPO, 0.5 CPO and 1.0 CPO, respectively. It was found that the 
1% CPO constructs have lower swelling ratio and pore size compared to 0.5% CPO 
constructs, which corresponds to the highest O 2 releasing rate associated with 0.5 CPO 
constructs during the first 30 min of bioink preparation, printing and curing (Fig. S3).Erdem et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript3.3. Mechanical Properties of 3D Printed O 2 Releasing Hydrogels
The effect of CPO concentration on the mechanical properties of crosslinked O 2 releasing 
hydrogels was examined by obtaining stress-strain curve and Young’s modulus from the 
unconfined compression testing at room temperature. Young’s modulus of O 2 releasing gels 
varied with CPO content as shown in Fig. 4. It is seen that increasing CPO content leads to 
decreased compression modulus of hydrogels. However, O 2 release influences the modulus 
of the hydrogels. While the highest value of the modulus was obtained from 0% CPO 
hydrogels, the lowest one was obtained from 0.5 CPO hydrogels. Similar trend was observed 
with the compression stress and CPO containing hydrogels.
Fig. 4C, shows storage and loss moduli of the hydrogels. Note that angular frequency 
increases from 0.1 to 10. It can also be seen that storage modulus for all hydrogels is higher 
than loss modulus, demonstrating elastic behavior of the hydrogels, which enables them to 
have self-support and preserve their mechanical integrity. Hydrogels without CPO had the 
highest storage moduli, and this is expected to decrease with the addition of CPO to the 
hydrogels. The difference between loss and storage moduli decreases with increased CPO 
content, which demonstrates less elasticity and more stiffness. However, 0.5 CPO hydrogels 
have higher loss modulus compared to 1.0 CPO hydrogels. Since high amount of CPO is 
associated with an increase in pH, this will ultimately decrease the storage modulus. 
Although 0.5 CPO shows lower Young’s modulus, 3D bioprinted constructs with 1cm x 1cm 
dimensions cultured for seven days were mechanically stable and capable of preserving their 
mechanical and biological integrity. Fig. 1B–E shows a 3D bioprinted construct that 
preserved its mechanical stability after being passed through pipette tip (Fig. 1B–E) Fig. 1B 
shows a 5mm x 5mm 3D bioprinted construct. These constructs are mechanically stable 
even after multiple injections (Fig. 1C–E) (Video 1,2 in supplementary material).
3.4. Oxygen Release Kinetics From CPO-GelMA Hydrogels
The decomposition of CPO to O 2 occurs in two steps. Fist, CPO reacts with water to 
produce H 2O2 and Ca(OH) 2 leading to increased pH. Secondly, H 2O2 decomposes to water 
and O 2 (Eq. 1). Increased pH will affect the H 2O2 production rate in the hydrogel [ 32]. 
Because H 2O2 can be toxic to cells, catalase was added to make H 2O2 decomposes to O 2 
[33]. As it is seen in Fig. 5, O 2 content of constructs having no CPO is ~0%, while CPO 
containing printed constructs provided sustained O 2 release for seven days.
CaO 2(s) + 2H 2O Ca(OH) 2(s) + H 2O2
2H2O2O2+ 2H 2O(Eq. 1)
At the CPO concentration of 0.5%, pH is lower than CPO with 1% (more CPO is associated 
with higher pH upon its dissociation). It was previously shown that CPO degrades faster at 
lower pH, leading to increased amount of released O 2 [34] (Fig. S3). This highest releasing 
rate increases the porosity while decrease the mechanical properties of 3D printed 
constructs, as it was discussed in previous sections. Although CPO containing constructs are 
associated with burst release of O 2, 1 CPO printed constructs release ∼30% of O 2 at day 1, 
∼9% at day 5, and ∼4% at day 7 post-printing. In addition, 0.5 CPO and 0.1 CPO constructs 
release O 2 around 3% and 1% after seven days, respectively. This release profile can be Erdem et al. Page 9

CPO capable of generating O 2. Nevertheless, CPO containing printed constructs were able 
to provide an oxygenated microenvironment for at least seven days.
3.5. Biological Function of The Resulting 3D Constructs
3.5.1. Cell viability— CPO concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% in GelMA constructs 
were tested for the assessment of cell viability at four and seven days post-printing. As it can 
be seen in Fig. 6, increasing the concentration of CPO to 1% had a negative impact on 
fibroblast viability which might be due to the toxicity resulting from the use of excessive 
amount of CPO . The addition of CPO up to 0.5 % was found to enhance cell viability both 
at day 4 and day 7 in hypoxia, which was comparable to that seen normoxia levels. This 
means that the harmful effects of a hypoxic microenvironment can be prevented by using 
CPO in GelMA bioink. According to quantification data in Fig. 6b, the difference between 
the number of live cells in 0.5 CPO and 0 CPO constructs was statistically significant 
(p<0.05 and p<0.01).
According to the findings of the present study, the addition of CPO to bioinks can improve 
cell viability in printed constructs incubated under hypoxic conditions, which can be useful 
for application in the treatment of ischemic conditions, e.g., following myocardial infarction 
[8]. This effect on cell viability was observed not only with 3T3 fibroblasts but also with 
cardiomyocytes. Fig. 7, shows live/dead staining and related cell viability quantification of 
cardiomyocyte-laden GelMA constructs having either 0% or 0.5% CPO that were incubated 
under either hypoxic or normoxic conditions for days 3, 5 and 7. Homogenous distribution 
of living cells in the constructs can be seen throughout the printed structure having 0.5% 
CPO. There was significantly higher number of living cells in CPO containing constructs as 
compared to constructs having no CPO, at different time points of 3, 5 and 7 days of 
incubation. This preservation of cell viability over seven days by using CPO can be related 
to reduced levels of lactate dehydrogenase levels resulting from decreased number of dead 
cells [ 16]. The oxygen-generating properties of CPO-GelMA would not only enhance cell 
survival by reducing hypoxic stress, but also by reducing necrosis-induced injury to both 
cells and tissues.
3.5.2. Cell metabolic activity— To assess the metabolic activity of cells, CCK-8 assay 
was used. However, it should be noted that CCK-8 which is regularly used to assess cellular 
metabolism, shows only glycolytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) production, 
one facet of cell metabolic activity [ 35]. According to CCK-8 assay, it was found that 
metabolic activity of 3T3 fibroblasts in 3D bioprinted constructs having no CPO was 
significantly decreased in hypoxia compared to normoxia (Fig. 8). Upon increasing the CPO 
concentration in the constructs, cell metabolic activity increased at days 4 and 7. The 
metabolic activity of cells in constructs having 0.5% CPO in hypoxia was similar to that of 
cells cultured under normoxic condition. The deference in metabolic activity between 
constructs having no CPO and those having 0.1 or 0.5 CPO was statistically significant 
(p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). However, similar to live/dead results, fibroblasts in 3D 
constructs having 1% CPO had the lowest metabolic activity. These results suggested that 
CPO in the bioink can provide O 2 rich environment within printed constructs that can help Erdem et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcells in overcoming ischemic challenge. Similar observation was made with improved 
metabolic activity of cardiomyocytes in CPO containing 3D printed constructs. The addition 
of CPO significantly enhanced cardiomyocytes proliferation (Fig. 9), suggesting that CPO 
can help in improving cell viability and proliferation even when constructs are kept under 
hypoxic conditions. The incorporation of CPO into the GelMA bioink can eliminate the 
adverse effects of hypoxic microenvironment for seven days.
Accordingly, the addition of CPO to bioinks and printing of cellular constructs may be a 
viable option for regenerative therapeutics that ensures the supply of O 2 required for 
metabolically demanding cells such as cardiomyocytes, especially when oxygen supply is 
interrupted. Video 3 in supplementary material shows the contractile activity of 
cardiomyocytes in the 3D printed constructs having 0.5% CPO at day 7 of incubation.
4. CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study demonstrate that 3D bioprinting can be used to develop oxygenated 
tissue constructs by using calcium peroxide as an O 2 source in the bioink. Optimal 
concentration of O 2 was found to be associated with the use of 0.5% CPO, since with higher 
concentrations, cell viability appears to be compromised. Catalase was used to achieve safe 
conversion of CPO into O 2 and avoiding the release of H 2O2. With the use of such optimal 
CPO concentration in fibroblast or cardiomyocyte-laden GelMA printed constructs, cell 
viability and function can be significantly enhanced when cultured in hypoxic conditions. 
This study suggests that oxygenated bioinks can be a viable solution to solve current 
challenges of tissue engineering and tissue regeneration by supplying cells in tissue implants 
with O 2 before angiogenesis takes place. Oxygen releasing 3D bioprinted constructs 
developed in this study can significantly benefit regenerative therapeutics. Further in vivo 
results can be useful to demonstrate the effectiveness of such bioprinted constructs using 
minimally invasive procedures and help the translation of such oxygenated constructs to the 
clinic.

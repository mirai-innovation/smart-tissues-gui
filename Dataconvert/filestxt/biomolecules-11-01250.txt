Abstract: Current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases aim to alleviate the symptoms experi-
enced by patients; however, these treatments do not cure the disease nor prevent further degeneration.
Improvements in current disease-modeling and drug-development practices could accelerate effec-
tive treatments for neurological diseases. To that end, 3D bioprinting has gained signiÔ¨Åcant attention
for engineering tissues in a rapid and reproducible fashion. Additionally, using patient-derived stem
cells, which can be reprogrammed to neural-like cells, could generate personalized neural tissues.
Here, adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were bioprinted using a Ô¨Åbrin-based
bioink and the microÔ¨Çuidic RX1 bioprinter. These tissues were cultured for 12 days in the presence
of SB431542 (SB), LDN-193189 (LDN), purmorphamine (puro), Ô¨Åbroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8),
Ô¨Åbroblast growth factor-basic (bFGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to induce dif-
ferentiation to dopaminergic neurons (DN). The constructs were analyzed for expression of neural
markers, dopamine release, and electrophysiological activity. The cells expressed DN-speciÔ¨Åc and
early neuronal markers (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and class III beta-tubulin (TUJ1), respectively)
after 12 days of differentiation. Additionally, the tissues exhibited immature electrical signaling
after treatment with potassium chloride (KCl). Overall, this work shows the potential of bioprinting
engineered neural tissues from patient-derived MSCs, which could serve as an important tool for
personalized disease models and drug-screening.

1. Introduction
Currently, animal models are used for disease modeling and in the drug-discovery
process [ 1]. However, these models can be improved upon to accurately identify the efÔ¨Åcacy
and toxicity of potential drug targets. Additionally, they cannot capture the complexities
and variability of human-neural tissues, which are necessary for accurate models [ 1‚Äì4].
One alternative to animal models is to use human-derived stem cells in combination with
3D bioprinting to generate neural tissues. For example, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
can be obtained from patients and reprogrammed to neural cells making them an effective
source for personalized medicine. For this reason, this study focuses on 3D bioprinting
MSCs that are reprogrammed into neuronal-like tissues to make a personalized neural
model.
3D bioprinting has become a commonly used tool for neural tissue engineering
applications as this process can rapidly and reproducibly generate tissue constructs based
on speciÔ¨Åcations given in a digital Ô¨Åle [ 5]. This process requires encapsulating the target
cell type in a supportive bioink; however, due to the complexities and fragility of the
brain and neural micro-environment, accurately reproducing the central nervous system
(CNS) using this bioprinting process is more challenging [ 2,6]. Accordingly, the bioink
Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081250 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomoleculesBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 2 of 15
formulation should mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) to support cell-cell and cell-
matrix interactions, cell proliferation, morphology, and differentiation [ 7]. Consequently,
Abelseth et al. developed a novel Ô¨Åbrin-based bioink that supports the differentiation of
human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into neurons [ 8]. The novel bioink consisted
of Ô¨Åbrinogen and alginate, which was then cross-linked with genipin, chitosan, thrombin,
and calcium chloride [ 8]. This bioink supported the generation of hiPSC-derived neural
tissues with high-cell viability and differentiation, as well as glioblastoma multiforme and
astrocyte cells, which indicated its supportive properties for engineering a variety of neural
tissues [8‚Äì12].
Several bioprinting techniques exist for generating 3D tissues including inkjet, ex-
trusion, laser-assisted, and stereolithographic methods [ 13]. However, extrusion-based
printers can print a variety of materials with varying viscosities‚Äîmaking it a conven-
tional bioprinting strategy [ 2,13]. This digitally controlled process uses either a pressure
or mechanical system to extrude biomaterials via a nozzle or syringe to form continuous
Ô¨Åbers [ 2,13]. Nozzle-based bioprinters that require advanced microÔ¨Çuidic-chips can gen-
erate complex and highly biomimetic tissues by specifying the motion of the printhead
and controlling pressure levels, which allows for microscale resolution and customizable
cell and material patterning [ 13]. This printing process enabled the generation of tissues
with the potential to mimic the complexities of human brain tissues. Neural cells are
extremely responsive to environmental stresses, meaning that shear forces experienced by
the cells during the bioprinting process must be minimized to avoid low cell viability and
functionality [ 8,9,14]. Aspect Biosystems‚Äô RX1 bioprinter (Aspect Biosystems, Vancouver,
BC, Canada) uses a microÔ¨Çuidic printhead made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), also
known as a Lab-On-a-Printer (LOPTM), to deposit the bioink and crosslinker in a coaxial
arrangement, where the crosslinker surrounds the bioink as it passes through the print
nozzle [ 15,16]. This unique arrangement allows for the bioink to polymerize prior to being
deposited, limiting the amount of shear stress experienced by the cells during extrusion,
making it an effective technique for bioprinting stem cell-derived tissues [8‚Äì12,15,16].
Stem cells can both replicate to more stem cells and differentiate into a variety of cells,
making them a powerful tool for 3D bioprinting [ 17]. MSCs are multipotent adult stem
cells that can be derived from bone-marrow, umbilical cord, skin, and adipose tissue [ 18].
MSCs can directly differentiate into mesodermal lineages and transdifferentiate into non-
mesodermal lineages such as neurons [ 18‚Äì21]. For example, Trzaska et al. [ 22] differentiated
bone marrow MSCs into DNs, in 2D cell culture, for 12 days by using Ô¨Åbroblast growth
factor 8 (FGF-8), basic Ô¨Åbroblast growth factor (bFGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), and sonic hedgehog (SHH). Adipose-derived MSCs are the most promising for
neural tissue engineering as they are easy to acquire in large numbers, and their robust
nature allows them to survive the shear stresses during bioprinting [ 23,24]. During the
neural induction process, adipose-derived MSCs also exhibit greater proliferation rates,
increased neural marker expression and electrophysiological activity, in comparison to
MSCs derived from other tissues [ 21]. Additionally, the ease of acquiring MSCs from a
patient in comparison to the process required to generate hiPSCs, makes them a valuable
tool for engineering personalized neural tissue models for both drug discovery and disease-
modeling applications [25].
Multiple studies have 3D bioprinted scaffolds which are later seeded with MSCs for
cartilage and bone tissue engineering [ 26‚Äì29]. However, MSC-laden bioinks have yet to
be used for bioprinting neural tissues. Accordingly, here we 3D bioprinted MSCs using
our Ô¨Åbrin-based bioink into half spheres to resemble the brain. Then, these MSCs were
treated with factors to induce their differentiation into DNs based on the protocol by
Trzaska et al. [ 22], with changing SHH to its agonist (purmorphamine), and the addition
of LDN193189 (LDN) and SB431542 (SB). We then characterized these constructs after
twelve days of culture in terms of viability, differentiation state, dopamine release and
electrophysiological activity.Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 3 of 15
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cell Culture Expansion of MSCs
Human adipose-derived MSCs (Cat. No. 7510, ScienCellTM, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
were cultured in a Ô¨Åbronectin coated T75 Ô¨Çasks in MSC Medium (MSCM, Cat. No. 7501,
ScienCellTM, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Upon reaching
90% conÔ¨Çuency, the cells were cryopreserved in Dulbecco‚Äôs ModiÔ¨Åed Ealy Medium (DMEM,
Cat. No. 11960044, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO,
Cat. No. 472301, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) using a slow rate-controlled cooling protocol
(stored at  80C overnight and then in liquid nitrogen (  135C)).
2.2. Bioink Preparation
All components of the bioink, crosslinker, and buffer solution were prepared based on
the protocol by Abelseth et al. [ 8]. BrieÔ¨Çy, for the bioink, Ô¨Åbrinogen (Cat. No. 341578, EMD
Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) was prepared at a concentration of about 50 mg/mL
in tris-buffered saline (TBS) solution and sterilized using a 0.2 m syringe Ô¨Ålter. Sodium
alginate (Cat. No. 180947, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was prepared at 2% w/vby
reconstituting in distilled water and sterilized using a 0.2 m syringe Ô¨Ålter. Genipin (Cat.
No. G4796, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was reconstituted at a concentration of
25 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide solution (DMSO). The Ô¨Ånal concentration in the bioink
for Ô¨Åbrinogen, sodium alginate, and genipin was 20 mg/mL, 0.5% w/v, and 0.3 mg/mL,
respectively. Additionally, the bioink protocol by [ 8] was slightly modiÔ¨Åed by adding 0.5%
of phenol red, premixed in TBS, to enable better visualization of the construct during the
printing process. The MSCs were then thawed and mixed with the bioink at a concentration
of 2106per 1 mL of bioink. Furthermore, the crosslinking solution consisted of 20 mg/mL
of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) (Cat. No. C1016, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), thrombin
at 1.7 UM/mL (Cat. No. T7009, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and chitosan at
0.075% w/v(Cat. No. C3646, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Prior to combining all
components of the crosslinker, CaCl 2was prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/mL in
sterile TBS. Thrombin was reconstituted at a concentration of 1000 UM/mL in sterile TBS.
Chitosan was prepared at a concentration of 25 mg/mL using 1% acetic acid, and the pH
was adjusted to 7.4 using -glycerolphosphate ( -GP) (Cat. No. G9422, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). The crosslinking solution was then prepared and sterilized by Ô¨Åltering
using 0.2 m syringe Ô¨Ålters. The buffer solution consisted of a TBS solution.
2.3. Bioprinting MSCs
All the bioprinting was performed under sterile conditions. The bioink, buffer, and
crosslinker were connected to the LOPTMprinthead (Aspect Biosystems, Vancouver, BC,
Canada) via tubing as done previously [ 8]. Figure 1 depicts the set-up of the different
components to the microÔ¨Çuidic printhead. The Ô¨Çow rate of the bioink and crosslinker
were controlled by having speciÔ¨Åc pressures for both channels to allow enough time for
the crosslinking reaction to occur in the nozzle, prior to being deposited on the vacuum
chuck. Additionally, the pressures and printing speed were optimized and kept consistent
throughout the printing process to produce homogenous constructs with even cell distribu-
tion, as shown in previous work [ 30]. The pressure of the crosslinker, bioink and buffer
were 60 mbar, 50 mbar, and 100 mbar, respectively. The printing speed was 25 mm/s which
allowed for four half-spherical constructs to be printed layer-by-layer in under Ô¨Åve minutes.
The bioprinted constructs were then carefully transferred using a sterile spatula to a 12-well
cell culture plate coated with poly-L-ornithine (PLO, Cat. No. P4957, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and laminin (Cat. No. L2020, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), containing MSC
media (Cat. No. 7501, ScienCellTM, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Three replicates were printed for
both control and experiment groups. The tissue design, which can be seen in Figure 1c,
consists of 7 layers, and a 40% rectilinear inÔ¨Åll pattern. This design was chosen according
to previous experiments performed by our group, where the mechanical and physical
properties were analyzed. In this study, the elastic moduli, storage and loss modulus,Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 4 of 15
viscosity, and shear rates were measured. The results from these experiments conÔ¨Årmed
that the bioprinted tissues possessed mechanical properties that were similar to native
neural tissue. Furthermore, the elastic modulus was around 1 kPa, which is the optimal
stiffness for neuronal differentiation [ 31]. Physical properties such as porosity, microstruc-
ture, swelling, and biodegradability were also analyzed. The tissues had a porosity of
66.13.2%, indicating that there is adequate diffusion of nutrients and gases, and removal
of metabolic waste, promoting differentiation and proliferation [ 31]. The degradation ratio
was 27.8 0.6%, which is sufÔ¨Åcient for short-term experiments [ 31]. However, the study
also found that incorporating microspheres into the bioink lowered the degradation ratio
to 15.9 1.0% [ 31]. Thus, if longer experiments are performed in the future, it would
be ideal to incorporate drug-releasing microspheres. These results are promising since
typically, Ô¨Åbrin polymerized by thrombin and CaCl 2degrades in one to two weeks due
to proteases released from the incorporated cells [ 31]. However, the addition of genipin
creates a multi-material scaffold by crosslinking with Ô¨Åbrin and chitosan, which stabilizes
the bioprinted tissue.

2.4. Cell Culture Conditions 
In addition to the 3D constructs , a 2D cell culture was prepare d by coating a 12-well plate with PLO (Cat. No. 
P4957, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and laminin (Cat. No. L2020, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1 √ó 105 MSCs

Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 100 ng/mL of FGF8 (Cat. No. 423-F 8-025, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, 
USA), 50 ng/mL of bFGF (Cat. No. 233-FB-010, R&D Systems, Minne apolis, MN, USA), 100 nM of LDN-
193189 (Cat. No. 72147, STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, C anada), and 10 ¬µM of SB431542 (Cat. No. 
72232, StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) to induce the differentiation process. The cells were then 
incubated at 37 ¬∞C with 5% CO 2 for 9 days, with no media changes in between. On day 9, 50 ng/ mL of BDNF (Cat. 
No. 450-02, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) was directly added to the experimental cells, without changing the

2.4. Cell Culture Conditions
In addition to the 3D constructs, a 2D cell culture was prepared by coating a 12-well
plate with PLO (Cat. No. P4957, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and laminin (Cat. No.
L2020, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 1 105MSCs per well were seeded. The 3D
constructs and 2D cell cultures were incubated in MSC media (Cat. No. 7501, ScienCellTM,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) overnight, at 37C and 5% CO 2. On day 0 the following were treated:
(a) control cells were treated with 2 mL of Neurobasal Media (NBM) (Cat. No. 21103049,
ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), containing 2% B27 (Cat. No. 17504001, ThermoFisher,

Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), 100 nM of LDN-193189 (Cat. No. 72147, STEMCELL
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), and 10 M of SB431542 (Cat. No. 72232, StemCell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) to induce the differentiation process. The cells were
then incubated at 37C with 5% CO 2for 9 days, with no media changes in between. On
day 9, 50 ng/mL of BDNF (Cat. No. 450-02, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) was directly
added to the experimental cells, without changing the media. They were then incubated
for an additional three days, for a total of 12 days. A schematic of the cell culture period
can be seen in Figure 2.

2.5. Cell Viability
Viability was assessed on the following days: (i) 0 (immediately after printing); (ii)
day 9 (prior to the addition of BDNF); and (iii) day 12 using the LIVE/DEADTMViability/
Cytotoxicity kit (Cat. No. L3224, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). First, the medium
was removed from the constructs followed by a wash with Dulbecco‚Äôs phosphate-buffered
saline (DPBS). The DPBS was then removed, and the constructs were treated with 0.05%
Calcein AM and 0.2% ethidium homodimer-1 in DPBS as per the manufacturer‚Äôs instruc-
tions. The constructs were then incubated at 37C with 5% CO 2for 30 min. Following
this, the day 0 and day 9 constructs were imaged using a Leica DMI300 B microscope
with an X-Cite Series 120Q Ô¨Çuorescent light source (Excelitas Technologies), a QImaging
RETIGA 2000R camera at 10 magniÔ¨Åcation, and images were captured using the Qcapture
Software 2.9.12. On day 12, the constructs were imaged using the FIPS-Zeiss Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscope at 10 magniÔ¨Åcation. Viability was quantiÔ¨Åed by imaging one
spot on the construct and taking 15 images in varying Z-planes. A Z-projection was then
created using ImageJ V1.52a, and the number of live and dead cells were counted using
the ImageJ software to determine the viability throughout the construct.
2.6. Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed on both 3D and 2D cultures on day
12 to visualize the early neuronal marker TUJ1, and dopamine-speciÔ¨Åc marker tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH). The media was removed, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and
Ô¨Åxed with 10% formalin and incubated at room temperature for 10 min (for 2D culture) and
20 min (for 3D culture). Formalin was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, with
2 min incubations at room temperature. The formalin was then removed, the cells were
washed with PBS twice, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X (Cat. No. HT501128, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min (for 2D culture) andBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 6 of 15
45 min (for 3D culture). The Triton-X was removed, and the constructs were blocked with
5% normal goat serum (NGS) (Cat. No. ab7481, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and incubated for
1‚Äì2 h, at room temperature. Then, two primary antibodies were added: anti-TH (Cat. No.
ab112, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) at 1:500 and anti-TUJ1 (Cat. No. MAB1195, R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) at 1:100 dilution in 5% NGS, incubated at 4C overnight with
shaking at 100 rpm, and washed 3 times with PBS after incubation. Then, the secondary
antibodies, goat anti-mouse (Alexa Fluor¬Æ488) (Cat. No. D1306, ThermoFisher, Waltham,
MA, USA) and goat anti-rabbit (Alexa Fluor¬Æ568) (Cat. No. A11011, ThermoFisher,
Waltham, MA, USA), were added at a 1:200 dilution in 5% NGS and incubated for 2 h at
room temperature with shaking at 100 rpm. Cells were then washed twice with PBS. Lastly,
the cells were stained with 300 nM of DAPI (Cat. No. D1306, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA,
USA) diluted in PBS, incubated for Ô¨Åve minutes at room temperature, followed by two
washes with PBS. The cells were imaged using the FIPS-Zeiss Confocal Laser Scanning
Microscope. Following this, the number of DAPI-positive, TUJ1-positive, and TH-positive
cells was counted using the ImageJ V1.52a software. BrieÔ¨Çy, the cells were analyzed by
Ô¨Årst uploading the images to ImageJ, subtracting the background Ô¨Çuorescent as much as
possible, adjusting the threshold until only the cells were visible, performing watershed
segmentation, and analyzing the number of particles. Lastly, the number of TUJ1-positive
and TH-positive cells were divided by the DAPI-positive cells to determine the percentage
of cells that expressed each neuronal marker.
2.7. Dopamine Release
The cell culture supernatant was collected from 2D and 3D cultures, for both control
and experimental group on day 12. These were then analyzed for the concentration of
dopamine released using a dopamine-speciÔ¨Åc enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kit
by following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions (Cat. No. KA3838, Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan).
The output absorbance was read using the TECAN inÔ¨Ånite M200 Pro microplate reader
set to 450 nm with a 635 nm reference wavelength. Afterward, a standard curve was
obtained by plotting the mean absorbance readings ( n= 3) on the y-axis (linear) against
the corresponding standard concentrations (logarithmic) on the x-axis. A Spline curve
Ô¨Åt was then obtained using Prism 5 (GraphPad) statistical software, and the unknown
concentration values were interpolated for each unpaired absorbance reading (Table S1).
This assay is a competitive assay so as absorbance values decrease, the concentration
increases.
2.8. Electrical Properties
The electrophysiological activity of the DNs, for both the 2D and 3D cultures, was
measured by using a voltage sensitive dye on the TECAN inÔ¨Ånite M200 Pro microplate
reader. This method was used since the 3D tissues could not be patch-clamped. This
analysis was performed on three replicates for both control and experimental groups, and
three cell-free constructs (3D) or blank wells (2D) which acted as a control for background
Ô¨Çuorescence. First, a 1:1 ratio of FLIPR Membrane Potential Assay Kit Blue (Cat. No.
R8042, Molecular Devices, San Hose, CA, USA) was added to the cells and incubated in
the dark for 45 min at 37C with 5% CO 2. The plate was then read by the microplate
reader set to read Ô¨Çuorescent emission at 560 nm and take 25 reads from each well in 5 5
grid [ 32]. After the initial readings, KCl was added at a concentration of 56 mM, and the
3D constructs and 2D experiments were incubated for 30 min at 37C with 5% CO 2. After
incubation, the plates were read using the microplate reader under the same conditions
as above. All data were analyzed using excel and equations set out in the protocol by
Robinson et al. [32].
2.9. Statistical Analysis
For cell viability and electrophysiology experiments, a one-way ANOVA and Turkey
post-hoc analysis was conducted, using a conÔ¨Ådence level of 95% ( p< 0.05). For ICC results,Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 7 of 15
a two-tailed Student‚Äôs t-test, with a conÔ¨Ådence level of 95% ( p< 0.05), was conducted
to determine the statistical signiÔ¨Åcance between the control and experiment groups. All
statistical analyses were conducted on the Prism 5 (GraphPad) statistical software.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the Bioprinted Constructs
The 3D structures were half-spherical, 11.5 6.9 mm in diameter ( n= 3), and ap-
proximately 2.5 mm in height (Figure 3I). Phase contrast images of the 3D-printed MSCs
(Figure 3A‚ÄìH ) were taken on the following days: 0 (day tissues were printed), day 4, day 9
and day 12, at 10 magniÔ¨Åcation. Figure 3A‚ÄìH shows that MSCs were evenly distributed
throughout the construct using a layer-by-layer method and rectilinear pattern. It can also
be seen that as the constructs approached day 12, the control group showed more cell
death in comparison to the experimental group. These results match the 2D cell culture
experiment (Figure S1).

3.2. Cell Viability
Figure 4 shows representative images and quantiÔ¨Åed values of the constructs stained
for viability on day 0, day 9, and day 12. Viability on day 0 was performed immediately
after printing the constructs, on day 9 prior to adding BDNF, and on day 12 when the
induction was completed. Cell viability on day 0 was 88.4 1.3%, and on day 9 it was
13.40.1% for the control group and 92.9 0.2% for the experiment group. Finally, on day
12, cell viability was 53.4 1.6% for the control group and 93.5 0.7% for the experimentalBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 8 of 15
group. The decrease in viability for the control group in comparison to the experimental
group on day 12 agrees with our 2D cultures, where the number of DAPI-positive cells
was signiÔ¨Åcantly less in the control group when compared to the experimental group
(Figure S2F,J). While the same seeding density was used for both 2D groups, the control
group contained (2.17 0.04)105cells, whereas the experimental group contained
(7.620.76)105cells by day 12. These values were found to be signiÔ¨Åcantly different
after performing a two-tailed, unpaired, student t-test with a conÔ¨Ådence level of 95%. To
continue, the control group‚Äôs viability signiÔ¨Åcantly increased on day 12 in comparison to
day 9. However, the experimental group did not show any signiÔ¨Åcant differences in cell
viability between day 9 and 12. Lastly, a signiÔ¨Åcant difference was found between the
no-treatment group (day 0) and the control group on days 9 and 12, as well as with the
experimental group on day 12.
3.3. Immunocytochemistry
Figure 5 shows the immunocytochemistry results from day 12 for the 2D and 3D
cultures, for both control and experimental groups. When comparing the number of cells
expressing neural cell marker to the number of nucleated cells (DAPI expression), the
experimental group showed signiÔ¨Åcantly more TH and TUJ1 expression than the control
group ( p< 0.0001). For the experimental and control groups, 86.67 1.6% and 4.1 0.6%
of cells expressed TUJ1, respectively. TH expression in the experimental and control group
was 75.9 0.5% and 1.8 0.2%, respectively. It was also found that there were no neurite
extensions in the 3D culture, whereas in the 2D culture there was some neurite extension. To
extend, for the 2D cultures, 87 1.5% of the TUJ1-positive cells showed neurite extensions.
Additionally, the 2D cultures showed more TUJ1-positive (98.8 0.6%) and TH-positive
cells (98.5 0.2%) in comparison to the 3D cultures.
3.4. Dopamine Release
The dopamine released from the 3D experimental group, on day 12, was 5.47 0.18
pg/mL ( n= 3). This was signiÔ¨Åcant considering that for all 2D samples and 3D controls,
the absorbance readings were all above the standard curve, indicating that there was no
dopamine release. These results can be found in Figure 6.
3.5. Electrophysiological Activity
The results of the electrophysiological properties of the bioprinted tissues and 2D
cultures are shown in Figure 7. At rest, the experimental group had a potential energy of
3.51.2 mV in 3D and 18.1 0.6 mV in 2D, while the control group had a potential energy
of 11.3 3.4 mV in 3D and 11.3 1.2 mV in 2D. For the 3D cultures, these results show that
the experimental group had a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential (3.51.2 mV)
when compared to the control group (11.3 3.4 mV), indicating that the experimental
group was more electro-physically mature. In contrast, for the 2D cultures, the membrane
potential was higher for the experimental group. This potentially indicates that the 3D envi-
ronment allowed the cells to become more electro-physically mature. After excitation with
KCl, the experimental group‚Äôs potential energy increased signiÔ¨Åcantly to 25.31.9 mV for
the 3D cultures, and to 23.8 1.0 mV for the 2D cultures. Furthermore, the control group‚Äôs
action potential increased to 21.3 1.6 mV for the 3D cultures, and 19.83.2 mV for the
2D cultures. For the 3D cultures, there was a higher signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the
resting membrane potential and excited potential for the experimental group, since p< 0.05
for the control group and p< 0.001 for the experimental group. On the other hand, for
the 2D cultures, no signiÔ¨Åcant difference was found for the experimental group, but there
was a signiÔ¨Åcant difference in the control group ( p< 0.05). Lastly, when comparing the
membrane potentials between the 3D and 2D experiments, at rest and excitation, there was
only a signiÔ¨Åcant difference found between the experimental groups resting membrane
potential ( p< 0.001).Biomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 9 of 15

4. Discussion
In this study, MSC-derived neural-like tissues were successfully bioprinted using
our Ô¨Åbrin-based bioink and the RX1 bioprinter. To begin, our 2D studies showed that the
group treated with small molecules LDN193189 and SB431542 had more TH-positive cells,
indicating that neuron maturation improved in the presence of these small molecules. For
this reason, the printed constructs were differentiated for 12 days using growth factors
with the addition of LDN and SB. Immediately after printing the constructs, on day 0,
the percentage of viable cells was 88.4 1.3%. After 9 days in culture, the percentage of
viable cells was 13.4 0.1% for the control group and 92.9 0.2% for the experimental
group. Lastly, on day 12, the percentage of viable cells was 53.4 1.6% for the control
group and 93.5 0.7% for the experimental group. Comparisons between the control and
experimental groups on days 9 and 12, showed a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in the percentage of
viable cells for the control group. These results agree with our 2D experiments, where the
number of DAPI-positive cells in the control group signiÔ¨Åcantly diminished in comparison
to the experimental group on day 12. This could be attributed to the lack of media changes
throughout the 12 days of differentiation, which was done because [ 22] noted that there was
the production of factors that contribute to the generation of functional DNs. Additionally,
the viability results also imply that the growth factors and small molecules may aid inBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 12 of 15
cell viability. However, when comparing day 0 to day 12 of the experimental group, the
percentage of viable cells increased signiÔ¨Åcantly by 5.2 1.5%. The lower percentage on
day 0 in comparison to days 9 and 12 could be attributed to the inevitable environmental
stresses experienced by the cells during the bioprinting process. In addition, after 12 days
of differentiation, with no disturbances, the cells had a chance to proliferate, and the
number of viable cells increased accordingly‚Äîthese results also agree with our 2D cultures.
Viability percentages from this experiment are similar to previous viability claims for
3D-printed NPCs, indicating that our Ô¨Åbrin-based bioink and 3D bioprinting technique not
only supports NPCs but also MSCs [26,31].
ICC results of the 3D constructs showed that TH and TUJ1 cell expression per number
of DAPI-positive cells was higher for the experimental group than the control group.
However, no neurite extension was seen in the constructs in comparison to the neurite
extensions seen in 2D cultures. This could be attributed to the auto-Ô¨Çuorescent properties of
the bioink, which make it extremely challenging to image the cells and poor diffusion of the
molecules and growth factors into the construct. In the future, it would be recommended
to slice the construct and place it on coverslips prior to imaging. When studying the effects
of LDN and SB in the 2D cultures, ICC results showed that TUJ1-positive cells were also
TH-positive for the group that was treated with LDN and SB. Additionally, no signiÔ¨Åcant
difference was found between the TUJ1-positive and TH-positive cells. These results are an
improvement from the Trzaska et al. [ 33] paper, where out of a >90% population of TUJ1-
positive cells, 69% expressed TH. However, in the 3D experiments, out of 86.671.6% of
cells that expressed TUJ1, 75.9 0.5% of cells expressed TH. This could be attributed to
poor diffusion of the small molecules and growth factors into the construct. To extend,
mechanical and physical property experiments by Sharma et al. [ 31] showed that the
bioprinted tissues had a porosity of 66.1 3.2%, which suggests that all the components
of the media cannot diffuse through the construct and reach the cells. In contrast, in 2D
experiments, the small molecules and growth factors settle at the bottom of the plate where
the cells are attached and thus, no diffusion was necessary. A plausible solution to improve
diffusion in 3D cultures would be to incorporate drug-releasing microspheres into the
bioink.
Electrophysiology results showed that the resting membrane potential of the exper-
imental and control groups, for the 3D cultures, were 3.5 1.2 mV and 11.3 3.4 mV ,
respectively. Additionally, for the 2D cultures, the resting membrane potential of the exper-
imental and control groups were 18.1 0.6 mV and 11.3 1.2 mV , respectively. However,
for the 2D cultures, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference found between groups at the resting
membrane potential. For the 3D cultures, since the potential of the control group was much
higher than the experimental group, these results suggest that the experimental group
was more electro-physically mature than the control group. Additionally, since the resting
potential was signiÔ¨Åcantly hyperpolarized in the 3D cultures but not in the 2D cultures,
this suggests that the 3D environment allowed the cells to become more electro-physically
mature. However, since the resting membrane potential of the cells was not close to the
 70 mV found in vivo , these results indicate that immature electrical activity was occur-
ring. After the cells were excited, the potentials of the experimental and control groups
for the 3D cultures increased to 25.3 1.9 mV and 21.3 1.6 mV , respectively. For the 2D
cultures, the membrane potential increased to 23.8 1.0 mV for the experimental group,
and 19.8 3.2 mV for the control group. For the 3D culture readings, the experimental
group had a higher signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the excited membrane potential and
resting membrane potential, in comparison to the control group, indicating that electrical
stimulation in the experimental neural cultures was more signiÔ¨Åcant. In contrast, for the 2D
cultures, there was no signiÔ¨Åcant difference found in the experimental group, which further
indicates that the 3D environment allowed for greater neural maturation. It is important to
note that stem cell-derived DNs require extended periods of culture before developing fully
mature electrical activity in vitro . For example, Gonzales et al. [ 34] used guggulsterone (a
natural steroid) to differentiate DNs from hiPSCs and found that electrical activity was notBiomolecules 2021 ,11, 1250 13 of 15
observed until 90 days post-differentiation. For immature electrical activity to occur in this
short 12-day differentiation protocol, it suggests that the 3D microenvironment they were
cultured in allowed for faster electrophysical maturation.
DNs secrete dopamine to regulate voluntary movement, for this reason their ability
to release dopamine is an important physiological feature. In this study, the experimental
group secreted 5.47 0.18 pg/mL of dopamine after 12 days of differentiation. This was
signiÔ¨Åcant considering that for all 2D cultures and the 3D control group, there was no
detectable dopamine secretion. The amount of dopamine secreted in this experiment was
less than the amount reported by Gonzales et al. [ 34], where the amount of dopamine was
about 1 ng/mL. However, these hiPSC-derived DNs secreted dopamine after 24 days of
differentiation. Similarly, experiments by Robinson et al. [ 35] found that hiPSC-derived
DNs secreted dopamine after 41 days of neural induction. These results suggest that the
3D microenvironment of the neural tissues allowed for faster DN development when
compared to 2D cultures.
In future experiments, it would be beneÔ¨Åcial to bioprint the cells with drug-releasing
microspheres, thus allowing cells to receive a direct and controlled release of the drug rather
than having the molecules diffuse through the construct to reach the cells. A study using
microspheres was performed by De la Vega et al. [ 36], where purmorphamine (puro) and
retinoic acid (RA) loaded microsphere were incorporated into cell aggregates to promote
differentiation of iPSCs into mature motor neurons. After 35 days, their results showed
extensive and organized neurite growth extension. Similarly, a study by Sharma et al. [ 12]
showed that hiPSC-derived neural constructs containing guggulsterone microspheres
improved neuronal differentiation and cell proliferation in comparison to constructs that
were treated with soluble guggulsterone. A similar protocol could be followed for this
experiment by incorporating microspheres into the MSC-laden bioink and following the
printing methods previously described [ 8]. Lastly, it would be beneÔ¨Åcial to perform a
polymerase chain reaction as a future experiment to further verify marker expression and
conÔ¨Årm cell differentiation.
With further maturation, these MSC-derived neural tissues could be useful as a
disease modeling and drug-screening tool for Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD). Patients who suffer
from PD experience tremors, muscle rigidity, and imbalance due to the depletion of DNs
in the substantia nigra which is necessary for voluntary movements [ 35,37,38]. Some
treatments can alleviate these symptoms such as the drug levodopa but over time, this
drug causes uncontrolled movement and cannot cease the degradation of DNs nor cure the
disease [ 33,35,37,38]. We suggest that our neural tissues containing MSCs and Ô¨Åbrinogen
derived from patients with PD could potentially serve as a more accurate personalized
model to study the progression of PD. Additionally, with further maturation, these tissues
could also be personalized for potentil implantation urposes. With this knowledge, we can
better predict the efÔ¨Åcacy, safety, and toxicity of potential drug targets for treating PD.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we successfully bioprinted MSC-derived neural tissues using a Ô¨Åbrin-
based bioink and the RX1 bioprinter. Characterization of our neural tissues showed
high cell viability, expression of early neuronal marker (TUJ1) and DN marker (TH), and
dopamine release. Additionally, the tissues expressed immature electrical signaling when
exposed to KCl. These neural tissues can be personalized by using PD patient-derived
MSCs, making them a great tool for personalized disease-models and drug-screening.

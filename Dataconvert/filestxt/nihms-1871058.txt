Abstract
Gene therapeutic applications combined with bio- and nano-materials have been used to address 
current shortcomings in bone tissue engineering due to their feasibility, safety and potential 
capability for clinical translation. Delivery of non-viral vectors can be altered using gene-activated 
matrices to improve their efficacy to repair bone defects. Ex-situ and in-situ delivery strategies 
are the most used methods for bone therapy, which have never been directly compared for their

of polyethylenimine (PEI) complexed plasmid DNA encoding bone morphogenetic protein-2 
(PEI-pBMP-2) using the two delivery strategies, ex-situ and in-situ delivery. To realize these gene

the ex-situ delivery approach as alternative delivery strategies. We found that in-situ delivery of 
PEI-pBMP-2 significantly improved bone tissue formation compared to ex-situ delivery. Despite 
debates amongst individual advantages and disadvantages of ex-situ and in-situ delivery strategies, 
our results ruled in favor of the in-situ delivery strategy, which could be desirable to use for future 
clinical applications.

1. Introduction
Non-viral gene delivery based therapeutics for bone regeneration, including the delivery of 
foreign nucleic acids or osteogenic genes into cell milieu, has gained significant attention 
in inducing osteogenesis in vivo  leading to accelerated bone repair [ 1, 2]. It is difficult for 
most non-viral gene vectors to pass through the plasma membrane on their own due to 
their negative surface charges and hydrophilicity [ 3, 4]. Therefore, researchers have used 
delivery vehicles, including polymers and liposomes, in order to form complexes to achieve 
stable carrier systems and sufficient transfection efficiency [ 4–6]. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is 
one of the most commonly used synthetic cationic polymer for efficient delivery of nucleic 
acids (encoded plasmid-DNA (pDNA)) into cell nuclei by the formation of PEI-pDNA 
polyplexes, also known as complexes or nanoplexes, through electrostatic interactions [ 7, 
8]. The PEI-pDNA polyplex causes the endosome to swell and rupture due to osmolysis 
enabling earlier escape of complexes before lysosomal degradation; this is known as the 
proton sponge effect [ 7–9].
Both ex-situ [ 10, 11] and in-situ [ 12–14] delivery of pDNA into the targeted defect 
region have been previously investigated in order to test their efficiency in tissue repair 
and potential use in therapeutic applications [ 15]. The ex-situ delivery strategy involves 
transfection of specific cell population with a desirable gene outside of the body before 
in vivo  delivery [ 2]. Therefore, this strategy provides direct targeting of cells to uptake 
the gene of interest during the transfection process resulting in pre-determined transfection 
efficiency before their use in vivo  [16]. However, ex-situ delivery mechanism requires more 
processing time due to the cell culture work prior to transfection and implantation, which 
is not desirable for clinical applications. Additionally, the stem cell extraction process from 
patients requires invasive surgical procedures and could be burdensome for patients in 
critical conditions [ 10, 11, 15, 17]. On the other hand, in-situ delivery strategy of gene-based Moncal et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptgrowth factors could be a more attractive approach since it does not require cell extraction 
and expansion, and prolonged cell culture time are all avoided providing less complicated 
treatment for the repair of bone defects [ 18]. However, the in-situ delivery approach does not 
allow direct delivery of these polymer-based pDNA delivery vehicles into the specific cell 
population in vivo , causing possible side-effects due to non-specific interactions and uptake 
of the complexes by non-targeted cells [ 11, 15, 17].
In this study, we evaluated both ex-situ and in-situ delivery of PEI-pBMP-2 and compared 
their potential in repairing critical-sized rat calvarial bone defects using the intraoperative 
bioprinting (IOB, which is also known as in-situ or in-vivo bioprinting [ 19]) as a tool 
as highlighted in Fig. 1. Here, an osteogenic hard tissue bioink, developed in a previous 
work [ 20], where PEI-plasmid bone morphogenetic protein-2 (PEI-pBMP-2) polyplexes 
were loaded in to the bioink as the in-situ delivery strategy. On the contrary, PEI-pBMP-2 
polyplexes were used to transfect rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs(tPEI-
pBMP-2)) and then transfected cells were loaded into the bioink for IOB for the ex-situ 
delivery strategy. The IOB technology made it feasible to directly deliver gene-activated 
matrices in an anatomically customized shape into the calvarial defect site. Overall, this 
study aimed to compare in-situ and ex-situ delivery of PEI-pBMP-2, and the demonstrated 
results suggest the possibility of expanding the scope of gene delivery via IOB for bone 
regeneration.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. pDNA Preparation
pDNAs were prepared based on a previously published study [ 21]. Briefly, the chemically 
competent DH5 α™ bacterial strain ( Escherichia colispecies ) was transformed with pBMP-2 
(cat. no. SC119392, Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD). The transformed cultures were 
then expanded in Lennox L Broth (Research Products Incorporated, MT. Prospect, IL) 
overnight at 37 °C in an incubator shaker at 300 RPM. pDNA was extracted using a 
GenElute™ HP endotoxin-free plasmid maxiprep kit (cat. no. NA0410–1KT, Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, MO) and analyzed for purity using a Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments, 
Westborough, MA) by measuring the ratio of absorbance (A260 nm/A280 nm).
2.2. Formation of PEI-pDNA Polyplexes
PEI-pBMP-2 (N/P ratio of 10, where “N=molar number of primary amines in the polymer; 
P=molar number of phosphate groups in the pDNA backbone” [ 10]) complexes were formed 
by the addition of 75 μg of plasmid DNA (2000 μg/ml) into 100 μl of PEI (2 mg/ml) 
(Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 408727, MW: 25k) solution by manual pipetting [ 12] and further 
incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The use of N:P ratio 10 in the transfection of 
stem cells was based on extensive optimization studies carried out in earlier studies. These 
include studies comparing branched and linear PEI at different N:P ratios in vivo  [22], 
showing that an N:P ratio of 10 is optimal for transfection efficacy in human bone marrow 
stromal cells [ 12], human embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells [ 23] and human adipose 
derived mesenchymal stem cells [ 24].Moncal et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.3. Characterization of PEI-pDNA Polyplexes
After the formation of PEI-pBMP-2 complexes, the particle size distribution, mean particle 
size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential measurements were investigated (in 
triplicates) using Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Worcestershire, UK) at 25 °C.
2.4. Bioink Preparation
The bioink was prepared according to a recent work [ 20]. Briefly, 56% (w/v) β-
glycerophosphate ( βGP, Sigma-Aldrich) combined with 2% (w/v) chitosan solution (CS, 
Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 417963h) at a volumetric ratio of 1:9 (v/v) ( βGP:CS). Type-I 
collagen extracted from rat tails [ 25] was dissolved in 0.02N acetic acid solution at a 
concentration of 9 mg/ml (Coll) and then mixed with neutralized CS- βGP solution at a ratio 
of 1:4 (v/v) (Coll:CS- βGP). Next, freeze-dried collagen sponges were added to the solution 
to prepare a final concentration of 26.6 mg/ml of collagen and mixed for 30 min using 
an in-house developed paste mixer at room temperature until a homogenous solution was 
achieved. Finally, nano-hydroxyapatite particles (nHAp) (nanoXIM-HAp202, Fluidinova, 
Portugal) were added to the overall bioink solution and mixed for additional 10 to 15 min to 
achieve 106.67 mg nHAp/ml.
2.5. Bioink Preparation for in-situ Delivery
A total of 1250 μg of pBMP-2 was complexed with PEI (Sigma-Aldrich) to form polyplexes 
to deliver 50 μg of PEI-pBMP-2 complex per defect in vivo  (25 constructs per batch). The 
freeze dried polyplexes were mixed with the bioink solution using the in-house paste mixer 
until a homogenous mixture was achieved.
2.6. Cell Culture
For in-vitro study, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs, RoosterBio Inc., MD, USA) 
were cultured using MSC expansion media (R&D Systems, MN, USA) (growth media; 
GM) supplemented with Penicillin (100 IU/ml) - Streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (cat. no. 30–
002-CI, Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA) until usage. As an osteogenic media (OM), 
human osteogenic differentiation media (Cell Applications, USA) added with Penicillin-
Streptomycin was used.
For in-vivo study, as implantation of hMSCs was not possible into immunocompetent rats, 
allogenic rBMSCs were extracted from inbred 4-week-old male Fischer white rats (F344/
DuCrl, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) [ 25]. All animals were cared in 
the animal facility (Millennium Science Complex, PSU) and euthanasia procedures were 
according to American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) and The 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol #46591). Isolated rBMSCs 
were plated on 6-well cell culture plates in Minimal Eagle’s Medium, Alpha modification 
(αMEM; cat. no. 10–022-CV , Corning Cellgro®, Manassas, V A) supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (cat. no. 35–010-cv, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA), PS 
and 2.5 μg/ml Fungizone (cat. no. 15–290-026, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at 
37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator.Moncal et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.7. Bioink Preparation for Ex-Situ Delivery
Ex-situ delivery method was accomplished with transfecting hMSCs or isolated rBMSCs 
with PEI-pBMP-2 complexes, for in-vitro and in-vivo studies, respectively. rBSMCs at 0.5 
million were transfected for one reaction of PEI-pBMP-2 complex (75 μg pDNA/100 μl of 
PEI complex). The PEI complex dropwise was pipetted onto 2D seeded hMSCs or rBMSCs 
in αMEM (serum-free media) and mixed gently to ensure homogenous distribution over 
the cell growth area. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and then replaced 
with growth medium containing serum according to a previously published study [ 26]. The 
following day, 5 million hMSCs or rBMSCs (tPEI-pBMP-2) were collected and mixed with 
1 mL of bioink. ~320,000 transfected rBMSCs were loaded per construct and 50 μg of 
PEI-pBMP-2 was used per defect.
2.8. 3D Bioprinting of constructs for the in-vitro study
The in-house developed Multi-Arm BioPrinter (MABP) [ 27] was used for 3D bioprinting 
samples for the in-vitro study. The constructs were 3D bioprinted (using transfected or 
non-transfected hMSCs at 5 million cells/mL loaded into the bioink) at a bioprinting 
speed of 60 mm/min, a nozzle diameter of 410 μm and pneumatic pressure of 80 kPa. 
Bioprinting was performed at room temperature (25 °C) and the bioink was deposited on 
a temperature-controlled plate set at 44 °C [ 25]. The constructs were bioprinted in 5-mm 
diameter and 1-mm thickness, like the defect shape. Then, constructs loaded with transfected 
and non-transfected hMSCs were cultured with OM and GM, respectively. During the 
culture period, media was changed every other day.
As a negative control group, two-dimensional (2D) cultures were fabricated. For 
morphological characterization, 160,000 hMSCs were seeded on 22 mm × 22 mm sterile 
glass slides, which were placed inside a 6-well plate for culture. For quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, 320,000 hMSCs were seeded on 6-well plates, and 
GM or OM were added thereafter for transfected and non-transfected hMSCs, respectively.
Next, in-vitro study was proceeded using four groups: i) 2D hMSCs transfected with PEI-
pBMP-2 and cultured in GM, ii) 2D hMSCs cultured in OM, iii) 3D bioprinted hMSCs 
transfected with PEI-pBMP-2 and cultured in GM, and iv) 3D bioprinted hMSCs cultured in 
OM.
2.9. Cell Viability
To measure cell viability, LIVE/DEAD staining was performed using Calcein (0.15 mM) 
and ethidium homodimer-1 (2 mM) at Days 1 and 7. 2D and 3D bioprinted samples were 
stained for 30 min and captured using a Zeiss Axio Zoom fluorescent microscope (Carl 
Zeiss, Germany). Cell viability was obtained by the percentage of the number of live cells to 
the total number of cells.
2.10. Immunofluorescence staining
Cell morphology and osteogenic differentiation were observed by immunofluorescence 
staining at Days 7 and 21. To begin, 2D and 3D samples were fixed using 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 12 h at 4 °C. The following day, the samples were treated with Moncal et al. Page 5
Biofabrication . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2023 November 18.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min and 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 2 h. A mouse 
anti-runt-related transcription factor (RUNX2) antibody (1:500; ab76956, Abcam) and rabbit 
anti-bone sialoprotein (BSP; 1:500; ab52128, Abcam) were used to conjugate antibodies 
with samples at 4 °C for a day. After rinsing the samples using Dulbecco’s phosphate-
buffered saline (DPBS) once, nuclei and F-actin were stained by Hoechst (1:500; blue; 
Life Technologies) and phalloidin (1:100; red; a12380, Molecular Probes); osteogenic 
differentiation of hMSCs was visualized using Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG 
(H+L) secondary antibody (1:250; green; A11017, Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 647 goat 
anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1:250; cyan; A21245, Invitrogen). The samples 
were immersed in a staining solution for 1.5 h in an incubator at 37 °C before imaging using 
a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
2.11. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
For a quantitative measurement, gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Both 2D 
and 3D samples were prepared and cultured for 28 d. TRIzol® reagent (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) was used to isolate RNA from the samples, in which its concentration was 
measured by reading the absorbance to obtain the ratio of 260/280 nm using a NanoDrop 
(ND-1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Complementary deoxyribonucleic 
acid (cDNA) synthesis was carried out using T100 Thermal Cycler (BioRad) according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol of AccuPower® CycleScript RT PreMix (Bioneer, Korea). 
Thereafter, gene expression was analyzed with SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Each gene was filled 
in a 96-well plate. The fold-change of genes, including Col1, RUNX2, OCN, and BSP, was 
calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method and normalized with respect to housekeeping gene, 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Then, all groups were normalized 
to hMSCs at Day 1, which were set as 1-fold. The reader is referred to Table for a list of 
primers used in RT-PCR.
2.12. Surgical Procedures for Intraoperative Bioprinting
A total of 11 12-week-old inbred male Fischer 344 white rats were anesthetized with 
an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (Midwest Veterinary, Lakeville, MN) mixed with 
xylazine (LLOYD Inc., Shenandoah, IA) at a dose of 100 mg/kg for ketamine and 10 
mg/kg for xylazine after inhalation of isoflurane (2–5%) over 1–2 mins. When animals 
were fully anesthetized, artificial tears (Rugby Laboratories, Livonia, MI) were placed on 
eyes, and heads were shaved and treated with a betadine surgical scrub followed by ethanol. 
Bupivacaine (0.015 mg/kg) (Centralized Biological Laboratory, PSU) at a concentration 
of 2.5 mg/mL and buprenorphine (0.015 mg/kg) were injected subcutaneously before the 
surgery. A sagittal incision was made through the periosteum and was retracted to expose 
the calvarium. Two critical-sized calvarial defects (each with 5 mm in diameter) were drilled 
into the parietal bone on each side of the rat skull using a trephine bit, keeping the Dura 
mater intact.
The experiment was designed to include four major groups: i) negative control ( n=3), ii) 
bioink+rBMSCs (5 million cells/ml) ( n=6), iii) bioink+rBMSCs(tPEI-pBMP-2) ( n=6) for 
ex-situ delivery, and iv) bioink+PEI-pBMP-2 ( n=7) for in-situ delivery of plasmid particles. Moncal et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIOB was performed by pneumatically extruding the bioink using the in-house developed 
MABP [ 27] system following a spiral deposition at a bioprinting speed of 60 mm/min. 
Thereafter, periosteum and skin were sutured with simple interrupted 5–0 monocryl (Ethicon 
Inc., Somerville, NJ) and 4–0 vicryl (Ethicon Inc.) sutures, respectively. After the surgeries, 
animals were placed on warming pad allowing recovery and were observed closely until 
they awoke from sternal recumbency. Following the post-surgery recovery, a single dose of 
buprenorphine was administered every 12 h for a minimum of 24 h of analgesia. Animals 
were observed and weighed daily for at least 10 days post-surgery and weighed once a 
week after removing the sutures (10 days after the surgery). Animals were euthanized at 6 
weeks post-surgery by CO 2 inhalation (2 L/min) until breathing cessation and subsequently 
decapitated.
2.13. Assessment of Bone Formation
Micro-computed tomography (μCT) scanning of calvarial defects was performed with a 
vivaCT 40 scanner (Scanco Medical, Switzerland) (17.5 μm isometric voxels, 70 kV energy, 
114 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time) [ 28]. Image analysis was conducted using 
a cylindrical 3D oriented volume of interest with a radius of 2.5 mm and a height of 1 
mm in Avizo (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR), MATLAB (Natick, MA) after applying a 
gaussian smoothing filter (sigma 0.9) and a threshold cutoff of 300 mgHA/cm3. The bone 
volume divided by total volume (BV/TV%), normalized bone mineral density (BMD%) and 
bone coverage area (%) were calculated from the filtered and processed data. Note that, the 
volume fraction of nHAp in the bioink was calculated prior to in-vivo studies in order to 
determine the baseline mineralization and eliminate possible artifacts in the scanned samples 
from our calculations, which turned out to be negligibly small.
2.14. Histological Analysis
Calvarial explants were extracted from rat skulls at Week 6 post surgery, rinsed with DPBS 
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days at 4 °C. The explants were then decalcified 
with 0.5M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt (Research Products 
International, Mount Prospect, IL) for 6 weeks at 4 °C. After the decalcification process, 
samples were embedded in O.C.T. cyromatrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) embedding resin, 
sectioned using a Leica CM1950 Cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at −32 °C 
with 18 μm thickness, and stained in a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) automated staining 
platform (Leica Auto Stainer XL, Leica Biosystems) without applying any heat during 
the staining process. The stained sections were mounted using Neo-Mount® anhydrous 
mounting medium (Millipore) and imaged using a Keyence BZ-9000 (Keyence Corporation 
of America, Elmwood Park, NJ) fluorescence microscope under the bright field using a 
neutral density optical filter.
In order to visualize the collagen deposition histomorphometrically, sectioned samples 
were also stained using Masson’s Trichrome staining (MTS) kit (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. No. 
HT15–1KT) based on the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained samples were dehydrated 
gradually with ethanol, using Neo-Mount® anhydrous mounting medium (Millipore), and 
imaged using the Keyence BZ-9000 microscope as described before.Moncal et al. Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript2.15. Statistical Analysis
All data were presented as mean ± standard deviation unless stated otherwise. In order 
to compare three or more groups, data were analyzed by one-way ANOV A with post hoc 
Fisher’s individual tests for differences of means at a 95% confidence level (assuming equal 
variances). Differences were considered significant at p***<0.001, p**<0.01, p*<0.05. All 
statistical analysis was performed using Minitab 17.3 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA).
3. Results
The average size of the PEI-pBMP-2 polyplexes used in this study was determined to be 1.4 
μm. These polyplexes had the potential to be taken up by cells through the macropinocytosis 
pathway allowing the entry of micron-sized particles through large vesicles (0.5 – 10 
μm) present on the plasma membrane [ 29]. A PDI value of ~0.66 indicated a large 
diversity in size distribution amongst the PEI-pBMP-2 polyplexes, which might affect the 
transfection efficiency of the polyplexes (Fig. 2A). The zeta potential was measured as 
25mV demonstrating positively charged particles (Fig. 2B).
Cytocompatibility of the transfection (using PEI-pBMP-2) and 3D bioprinting processes was 
evaluated via LIVE/DEAD assay (Fig. 3A). For in-vitro evaluation, hMSCs were used at a 
density of 5 million cells/mL in the bioink. Specifically, four groups were used including 
i) 2D transfected hMSCs cultured in GM (2D-T), ii) 2D hMSCs treated with osteogenic 
media (OM) (2D-OM), iii) 3D bioprinted constructs loaded with transfected hMSCs and 
treated with GM (3D-T), and iv) 3D bioprinted constructs loaded with hMSCs and treated 
with OM (3D-OM). Each group was analyzed for cell viability at Days 1 and 7 (Fig. 3B). 
All groups showed high cell viability (> 90%), which was maintained from Day 1 through 
7, highlighting the fact that the transfection and bioprinting processes did not impair the 
viability of hMSCs.
For the same experimental groups, morphology and osteogenic differentiation of 
hMSCs were confirmed by immunofluorescent images showing phalloidin, RUNX2, and 
BSP counterstained with Hoechst (Fig. 4A). To elaborate, RUNX2, a multifunctional 
transcription factor for osteogenesis, was expressed in the nucleoplasm for all groups at Day 
7 and became more evident at Day 21 (Fig. 4A). Whereas BSP, a marker expressed at the 
late stage of ostegenesis, was not expressed in 2D groups at Day 21, but 3D groups revealed 
BSP expression at Day 21 (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that 3D bioprinted constructs and 
PEI-pBMP-2 transfection facilitated the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.
Furthermore, the expression of osteogenic markers (RUNX2, Col1, OCN, and BSP) were 
evaluated using RT-PCR. RUNX2 was 75-, 61-, and 14-fold higher on 3D-T compared to 
2D-T, 2D-OM, and 3D-OM, respectively. For Col1, an early-stage osteogenic marker, 3D-T 
and 3D-OM revealed significantly higher expression compared to 2D-T and 2D-OM. On 
the other hand, although OCN, a marker of mature osteoblasts, did not show any significant 
difference among all groups, 3D-T and 3D-OM were ~72- and ~28-fold higher compared to 
2D groups, respectively. In the meantime, BSP, which can be found specific for mineralized 
tissues, was significantly expressed in both 3D groups.Moncal et al. Page 8

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAfter confirming the cytocompatibility of the process and the osteogenic potential of 
the pBMP-2-transfected hMSC-laden 3D bioprinted constructs in vitro , IOB process was 
performed using MABP after surgically opening two, 5 mm-diameter critical-sized calvarial 
defects on rat skulls (Fig. 5), which is a well-established model for bone repair in the 
literature as a size of one tenth of skull does not heal spontaneously during the lifetime 
[30]. The animal head position was maintained fixed during surgeries. Next, IOB was 
performed by directly bioprinting bone constructs onto the defect site(s) allowing printhead 
to follow a spiral toolpath plan with a 100% infilled density to ensure complete filling of 
each defect in a controlled manner, where overall IOB process took <1 min per construct. In 
this study, we employed four groups including i) empty defect (control), ii) rBMSCs-laden 
bioink (no delivery), iii) rBMSCs(tPEI-pBMP-2)-laden bioink (ex-situ delivery), and iv) 
PEI-pBMP-2-laden bioink (in-situ delivery). The bioink crosslinking after extrusion was 
achieved by temperature induced physical crosslinking of collagen and CS- βGP at body 
temperature resulting in a rapid solution to gelation phase transition [ 31].
Six weeks post bioprinting, rats were euthanized for the evaluation of bone regeneration. 
Overall, both newly formed bone tissue and mineralized bone matrix were observed in all 
groups via μCT scanning (Fig. 6A). The in-situ delivery group demonstrated significant 
improvement in bone volume to total bone volume percentage (BV/TV) (%) compared 
to empty (~1.94-fold, p<0.001), no delivery (~1.86-fold, p<0.001) and ex-situ delivery 
(~1.33-fold, p=0.012) groups (Fig. 6B1). Additionally, the ex-situ delivery group improved 
bone repair significantly compared to the no delivery (~1.4-fold, p=0.030) and empty 
(~1.46-fold, p=0.048) groups. The normalized percentage bone mineral density (BMD) was 
determined to be higher for the in-situ delivery group compared to the empty (~1.8-fold, 
p<0.001), no delivery (~1.4-fold, p<0.001) and ex-situ delivery (~1.2-fold, p=0.030) groups, 
respectively (Fig. 6B2). Additionally, the ex-situ delivery group showed ~1.6-fold ( p<0.001) 
increase in normalized BMD% compared to the empty group and no significant difference 
was observed compared to the no delivery group. The no delivery group, on the other 
hand, demonstrated higher normalized BMD% compared to the empty group (~1.32-fold, 
p=0.045). No significant difference was observed between ex-situ and in-situ delivery of 
pDNAs in terms of the bone coverage area. In-situ and ex-situ delivery groups demonstrated 
~1.8- ( p<0.001) and 1.7-fold ( p=0001) increase in bone coverage area compared to the 
empty group, respectively (Fig. 6B3). The in-situ delivery group also showed a 1.3-fold-
increase in bone coverage area compared to the no delivery group ( p=0.009), whereas no 
significant difference ( p=0.057) was observed for the ex-situ delivery group. The no delivery 
group showed higher bone coverage area (~1.4-fold, p=0.048) in comparison to that of the 
empty defect.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Masson’s Trichrome staining (MTS) were 
performed on the decalcified sections to visualize the newly formed bone tissue matrix 
histomorphometrically. H&E images demonstrated the connectivity and compactness of 
newly formed bone tissue in the calvarial defects. The empty group demonstrated mostly 
soft tissue (ST) formation, which was visualized with a lightly pink color. A partial amount 
of newly regenerated bone tissue (RB) was detected nearby the defect edges in the empty 
group (Fig. 7A1). While the remaining groups were able to form bony bridge invading from 
one defect edge to another (Figs. 7A2–A4). The no delivery group had less dense RB tissue Moncal et al. Page 9

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcompared to ex-situ and in-situ delivery groups (Fig. 7A2). The highest nuclei density was 
also observed in the in-situ delivery group, which displayed densest RB tissue area with the 
least amount of ST formation compared to the other groups (Fig. 7A4).
The MTS images were used to display collagen matrix with bluish areas indicating 
immature and mature bone tissues in the calvarial bone defects (Figs. 7A1–4). The mature 
bone stained with a dark blue color, whereas the fibrous tissue with lightly blue color. 
The empty group demonstrated mainly light blue color and immature bone formation near 
by the host bone (HB), which were taken a dark blue color (Fig. 8A1). Additionally, 
there were quite many apparent red blood cells in the defect site indicating vascularization 
during ongoing bone repair process. Both no delivery (Fig. 8A2) and ex-situ delivery (Fig. 
8A3) groups exhibited a dense blue color nearby HB compared to the empty group. The 
in-situ delivery group had noticeable dense blue islands indicating immature bone formation 
throughout the defect (Fig. 8A4).
4. Discussion
In this study, the concept of combining the delivery of PEI complexed pDNA encoding 
BMP-2 with IOB was demonstrated for craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone regeneration. The 
attempts on delivery or transfection using various micro/nanoparticles, such as microRNA, 
chemically modified RNA, and cytokines, have been demonstrated to manipulate cell fate 
[28, 32, 33], but direct delivery via IOB is still in its infancy.
To prove this concept, we began with an in-vitro study to show the effect of PEI-pBMP-2 
and bioprinting on cellular activities including cell viability and osteogenic differentiation. 
As a control, hMSCs with and without transfection were cultured in 2D. Here, high cell 
viability (>90%) was observed at Days 1 and 7 regardless of transfection indicating that 
the transfection using PEI-pBMP-2 did not impair cell viability. Then, non-transfected 
and transfected hMSCs were used to bioprint 3D hMSC-laden constructs to compare the 
fate of hMSCs with respect to those in 2D groups. Similarly, 3D groups showed high 
cell viability (>90%) up to Day 7, which demonstrated the feasibility of bioprinting of 
PEI-pBMP-2-transfected progenitors for bone tissue engineering applications.
In addition, the effect of PEI-pBMP-2 on the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs was 
compared to that of the osteogenic media. The immunofluorescent images demonstrated 
that the expression of RUNX2 became more evident from Day 7 to 21 in both 2D 
and 3D groups. However, BSP was present only in 3D groups, which might be due to 
the synergistic effects of PEI-pBMP-2 transfection and presence of collagen in the 3D 
microenvironment [ 27, 33, 34]. For instance, rat BMSCs embedded in a methacrylamide 
gelatin bioink with BMP-2-collagen microfibers showed greater expression of osteogenic 
markers (alkaline phosphatase (ALP), BSP, OCN, and Col1) compared to those cultured 
without BMP-2-collagen microfibers [ 33]. To elaborate, BMP-2 and collagen have shown 
supporting effects in cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation, and for some clinical 
trials, eventually guided successful interbody fusions [ 35–37]. Hence, these results denote 
that the combinatorial approach of delivering PEI-pBMP-2 and the osteogenic bioink was 
favorable for osteogenesis.Moncal et al. Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe degree of osteogenesis was further examined quantitatively by RT-PCR. The results 
reveal that the transfected groups were as effective as OM groups to induce osteogenesis 
in both 2D and 3D environment. Compared with 2D groups, 3D groups generally showed 
higher quantitative values, which suggest that bioprinting is advantageous by providing 
a 3D microenvironment for progenitors to differentiate osteogenically. Since one of the 
purposes of IOB was to minimize the pre-processing time (i.e., cell preparation or culture 
period), transfected cells (ex-situ delivery) or in-situ delivery of PEI-pBMP-2 can be an 
efficient approach to induce osteogenesis when directly bioprinted into a defect site without 
differentiating cells for a long culture period prior to bioprinting.
In order to test the effectiveness of PEI-pBMP-2 using in-situ versus ex-situ delivery, we 
utilized IOB, which is deemed an effective technology for direct deposition of constructs 
into the defect site. This technology was previously demonstrated for the repair of calvarial 
bone defects in a mouse model using a laser-assisted bioprinting (LAB) system by delivering 
hydroxyapatite in collagen [ 34]. Even though LAB has a higher resolution, it might not 
be ideal for use in IOB towards translating this technology into clinics due to its time-
consuming nature and operational complexity [ 35]. Thus, extrusion-based bioprinting would 
be more suitable to directly print viscous bioinks into a defect site for hard tissue repair 
owing to its ease with scalability, and the ability to bioprint constructs in a simpler and rapid 
manner [ 36]. Although manual injection can also be utilized to deliver the bioink into the 
defect, IOB enables avoiding inconsistent deposition and non-uniform extrusion of bioink 
that eventually alters the amount of PEI-pDNA affecting cellular activities. In addition, to 
reconstruct complex-shaped contour zones of the cranium, IOB is a great tool providing 
a degree of freedom by its high precision and versatility, which can be utilized for high 
precision applications, such as IOB of thinner tissues (i.e., skin) or combination of such 
thinner tissues with the bone as demonstrated recently [ 20].
This study is the first attempt investigating the efficacy of in-situ versus ex-situ delivery 
of bioprinted PEI-pBMP-2 polyplexes to determine the more efficient delivery method for 
the repair of rat critical size calvarial defects. To improve the functionality of stem cells 
delivered to the defect site, there is a growing evidence that the delivery of gene-based 
growth factors within the cell membrane can be beneficial for improved vascularization 
[26] and mineralized bone tissue formation [ 37]. One of the greatest advantages of ex-situ 
delivery mechanism is to target a specific cell population and load it into the bioink before 
the delivery of gene activated matrices in vivo . In our study, ex-vivo transfection of rBMSCs 
were achieved in a 2D culture and then transfected cells were loaded into the bioink before 
the in-vivo delivery. This way, we could assume that the delivered stem cells had the ability 
to commit to osteogenic differentiation producing desired bone matrix proteins in vivo 
[17]. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study demonstrating implantation 
of constructs in vivo  using an ex-situ delivery method, specifically using stem cells that 
are transfected with PEI-based gene carriers for osteogenesis inducing factors. It has been 
previously reported that PEI-pDNA polyplexes transfected rBMSCs (1µg pDNA per 3×104 
cells) resulted in around 2–10% of transfection efficiency depending on N/P ratios [ 38]. In 
this study, we observed that transfection of rBMSCs with PEI-pBMP-2 polyplexes improved 
bone regeneration significantly compared to non-transfected rBMSCs despite its potentially 
low transfection efficiency in a 2D culture. On the other hand, the delivery of transfected Moncal et al. Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptrBMSCs into the defect site via IOB can also witness other challenges. For example, one 
of the major clinical concerns for injured CMF defects is the disruption of blood vessels 
surrounding the exposed defect site resulting in insufficient bone repair due to lack of 
vascular network formation, which eventually causes osteonecrosis [ 39]. Bone regeneration 
and repair depends on an effective vascular network of blood vessels to transport waste, 
nutrients, and other essential molecules [ 40]. After the delivery of cells into the defect site 
via IOB, damaged blood vessels surrounding the periphery of the defect might not have 
enough support of oxygen and nutrients to sustain the viability of cells and support their 
growth until newer blood vessels were formed. This could potentially lead to necrosis after 
the delivery of cells into the defect side due to hypoxia and starvation [ 41]. Therefore, 
vascularization will become a critical factor for the repair of larger CMF defects and the 
preservation of the viability of delivered cells in vivo . In this regard, incorporation of 
angiogenic pDNA encoding growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, 
fibroblast growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor, can mediate vasculogenic response 
to enhance vascularization during the bone remodeling process [ 42]. Additionally, the 
incorporation of oxygen releasing micro-particles can be considered, which will enable 
oxygenization of cells until vascularization takes place [ 43, 44].
In this study, we used 5×106 rBMSCs per mL, where the cell encapsulation density for 
hydrogels has been varied from 5 to 10 million cells/ml for bone tissue engineering [ 45]. 
On the other hand, the delivery of high cell density within the bioink might prove to be yet 
another reason for reduced bone formation. It has been previously shown that cell-to-cell 
distance effects osteogenic gene expression during osteogenesis [ 46]. Increased osteogenic 
gene markers, including ALP, OCN, Col1 and RUNX2, was noted on Days 8 and 14 when 
the seeding density of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells on calcium-phosphate 
cement was 300k compared to 50k [ 47]. On the contrary, reduced osteogenic activities and 
mineralization was reported on Day 14 when the cell density was 500k instead of 300k [ 47]. 
In addition to the required optimal cell density, the localization of cells (for example, near 
periosteum) on bone grafts also acts as yet another important factor to allow easier access 
to oxygen and nutrient source for cells [ 48]. In calvarial defects, the areas which are rich 
in blood vessels are the periphery of defect sites and periosteum. Therefore, bioprinting 
cells on top of bone grafts (along with cell encapsulation) might improve bone formation 
in vivo . In a nutshell, the potential reasons for lesser newly formed bone tissue for the 
bioink+rBMSCs (no delivery) group might be associated with two reasons: i) degradation of 
the bioink due to the growing number of rBMSCs inside, and ii) rBMSCs are not committed 
osteogenically due to limited osteogenic ques (such as BMP-2); rather, they grow and 
proliferate more. In this regard, as bone damage gets more extensive, multipotent nature 
of rBMSCs can be a potential risk like developing granulated tissues unless an undesired 
lineage progression can be completely avoided and controlled [ 49]. Moreover, the usage 
of allogenic BMSCs is not yet a fully validated method due to possibility of inflammation 
and immune rejection [ 50]. For these reasons, the transplantation of BMSCs can generate 
unexpected or impaired in-vivo results.
Despite several disadvantages including the possibility of unknown uptake of pDNAs from 
a wide variety of cell types or non-specific cell targeting in vivo  [15], or the attachment 
of released pDNA to HAp particles forming larger complexes resulting in lower uptake Moncal et al. Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptof PEI-pBMP-2 complexes by cells [ 51], the in-situ delivery of PEI-pBMP-2 resulted in 
significant improvement in bone tissue repair and formation of mineralized bone tissue 
compared to the ex-situ delivery group. The potential reasons for the in-situ delivery strategy 
inducing improved bone regeneration could be due to the acellular form of the bioprinted 
constructs resulting in slower degradation [ 20] and sustained release of the PEI-pBMP-2 
polyplexes compared to the cellular constructs. In specific, the addition of cells into the 
bioink (ex-situ or no delivery) could cause reduced bone formation by a series of effects 
such as reduced hydrogel stiffness leading to accelerated degradation rate and physical 
instability of bioprinted constructs. For instance, among collagen constructs seeded with 
6 × 105, 3 × 106, 3 × 107, and 1 × 108 cells/mL, a scaffold with cell density above 3 
× 106 cells/mL revealed a significant decrease in break force when tensile testing was 
performed immediately after compression at Day 10 [ 52]. Further, cell-induced collagenase 
activity expressed by matrix metallopeptidase 1 could be another factor resulting in a rapid 
breakdown of collagen matrix [ 52]. Hence, owing to the improved physical stability of 
bioprinted acellular constructs enabling the delivery of PEI-pDNA, we can conclude that the 
in-situ delivery provided a more favorable microenvironment for bone formation.
5. Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the repair capability of ex-situ and in-situ delivery strategies 
for bone therapeutic applications. The gene-activated matrices were loaded into a collagen-
based bioink and delivered into critical-sized calvarial defects using the IOB technology, 
which enabled direct bioink deposition into calvarial defects via an extrusion-based system. 
The delivery of PEI-pBMP-2 loaded bioink resulted in higher bone regeneration compared 
to the ex-situ delivery and no delivery groups. Overall, the in-situ delivery of gene-based 
growth factors combined with IOB technology could be beneficial to promote accelerated 
bone repair, which could be an effective and practical strategy.

Intraoperative bioprinting of bone before, during and after bioprinting using an extrusion-
based system, where the animal was positioned under the bioprinter after opening two 
critical-sized calvarial defects. During the surgery, the periosteum was maintained intact. 
Next, the animal head was stabled using the hooks to avoid instant head movements during 
the IOB process. The bioprinting process initiated with the deposition of bioink after the 
positioning the print head at the start point of the calvarial defect. The bioink was directly 
extruded in a spiral pattern to deliver a 3D construct less than 1 min per defect. After filling 
both defects, the periosteum was sutured and then the skin was closed back.Moncal et al. Page 21

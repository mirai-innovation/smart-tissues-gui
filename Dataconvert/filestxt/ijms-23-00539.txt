Abstract: In recent years, bioprinting has attracted much attention as a potential tool for generating
complex 3D biological constructs capable of mimicking the native tissue microenvironment and
promoting physiologically relevant cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions. The aim of the present
study was to develop a crosslinked 3D printable hydrogel based on biocompatible natural polymers,
gelatin and xanthan gum at different percentages to be used both as a scaffold for cell growth and as a
wound dressing. The CellInk Inkredible 3D printer was used for the 3D printing of hydrogels, and a
glutaraldehyde solution was tested for the crosslinking process. We were able to obtain two kinds of
printable hydrogels with different porosity, swelling and degradation time. Subsequently, the printed
hydrogels were characterized from the point of view of biocompatibility. Our results showed that
gelatin/xanthan-gum bioprinted hydrogels were biocompatible materials, as they allowed both
human keratinocyte and ﬁbroblast in vitro growth for 14 days. These two bioprintable hydrogels
could be also used as a helpful dressing material.

1. Introduction
Hydrogels are crosslinked, insoluble and hydrophilic polymers that are capable of
containing a large amount of water thanks to their porosity and three-dimensional network
structure [ 1]. The hydrophilic capacity of hydrogels is due to the presence of hydrophilic
groups along the polymer chain, while crosslinks can be built by electrostatic dipole–dipole
interactions and covalent bonds [ 2]. In recent years, hydrogels have aroused a signiﬁcant
interest in biomedical and clinical research due to their capacity to create a favorable
microenvironment for cell growth and/or differentiation [ 3]. Certainly, they have several
application domains, such as drug delivery [ 4,5], tissue engineering [ 2,6,7], regenerative
medicine [ 8,9] and wound dressings [ 10–12]. In particular, hybrid composite hydrogels
(made by gelatin, xanthan gum, glutaraldehyde and HPLC-grade water) have been shown
to exhibit good wound-healing ability [13].
Gelatin (Gel), which is produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen, displays good
biocompatibility and biodegradability properties and is commonly used in medical areas,
due to its great biological advantages and low cost [ 14]. Several studies have highlighted
the beneﬁcial effects of Gel for migration, adhesion and growth of cells in tissue regen-
eration processes [ 14–16]. Moreover, its biodegradability is the result of the presence of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cleavage sites, and it is an important characteristic for

the development of in vivo implanted hydrogels, since scaffold degradation allows for the
deposition and production of a new extracellular matrix [17].
Xanthan gum (Xnt) is a microbial-derived high-molecular-weight heteropolysaccha-
ride that is employed in medical ﬁeld and tissue engineering for its biocompatibility and
gelling characteristics [ 18], as well as being available at a low cost and easy to process [ 19].
For these important properties, it has been widely used in the pharmaceutic ﬁeld as a
thickener, suspender and emulsiﬁer [ 20] and also in the manufacture of biodegradable
hydrogels for skin scaffold [18,21].
An important limit of gelatin and xanthan-gum hydrogels is their mechanical weak-
ness and dissolution behavior in solvent [ 17]. It is known that, after immersion in water,
they present a severe swelling rate, due to the absorption of the solvent. This is a dis-
advantage for its employment as wound scaffold, because severe swelling will make the
dressings unable to maintain the structure of the dressings and ﬁt the wound [ 14]. To solve
this problem, hydrogels are stabilized by crosslinking to increase their material strength
and hydrolysis resistance, and to keep their shape, avoiding swelling phenomena [ 22].
Through crosslinking, it is possible to stabilize the chemistry of the polymer, extending the
chains, with consequent modiﬁcations of the network structure [23].
Crosslinking agents can be inserted into hydrogels through different methodologies,
such as physical methods and the use of chemicals or enzymes [ 24]. Among the chemical
methods, glutaraldehyde (GTA) [ 25,26] is one of the most used crosslinking agent in the
biomedical sector, despite its cytotoxicity at certain concentrations [ 25]. Crosslinking of
collagen derivatives with GTA includes the production of permanent junctions by reactions
between free amine groups of lysine or hydroxylysine amino acid residues in polypeptide
chains and aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde [ 23,27]. Moreover, GTA is easily available
at a low cost, and in aqueous solution, it allows crosslinking to be achieved in a relatively
short time [27].
Three-dimensional bioprinting is an early stage technology with important conse-
quences and applications in the biomedical and tissue-engineering ﬁelds, as it allows the
creation of 3D tissue constructs through programmed models and the distribution of the
so-called bio-ink by means of the movement of a motorized stage [ 28,29]. Bio-inks have
different compositions (biomaterials, biomolecules and cell) depending on their use; in fact,
properties such as printability, biocompatibility and physical strength could affect the ﬁnal
printed construct [ 30]. Then, the printed constructs could be crosslinked after bioprinting
to stabilize its ﬁnal shape and structure. This technique allows for the standardization of
the bioprinting process, with high reproducibility and precise control, potentially enabling
high-throughput production [ 29]. However, current 3D bio-printing methods still have
technical limitations to overcome, such as high-resolution cell deposition and controlled
cell distribution [28].
Considering this, the aim of present study was to develop a low-cost crosslinked 3D
printable hydrogel based on biocompatible natural polymers (gelatin and xanthan gum)
and characterize it as a cell-growth scaffold to use for both in vitro growth of tissues and
wound dressing.
2. Results
2.1. Bioprinting and Crosslinking
As reported in Table 1, different concentrations of Gel/Xnt were tested to achieve
maximum printability. In the framework of extrusion bioprinting, hydrogel printability
generally refers to the extrudability, ﬁlament formation and shape ﬁdelity. By modulating
the process and 3D printer parameters, it was possible to obtain predictable structures, as
were designed in the 3D printing software. The Slic3r program was used to modify the
code for a tissue model in order to optimize ﬁll pattern, speed, density and extrusion [ 31]. A
25-gauge (0.25 mm aperture) printer tip with pneumatic extrusion pressures below 21 kPa
was used. Gelatin (2.5 w/v% and 3 w/v%), along with xanthan gum (1.2 w/v%), resultedInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 3 of 16
in being printable and showed the best resolution, intended as shape ﬁdelity, using a
pressure range of 10 to 20 kPa.

After the printing process, three different concentrations (0.3, 0.5 and 1 v/v%) of
glutaraldehyde and two different immersion times (1 and 3 h) were used for the hydrogel
crosslinking test. The higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde, with a longer immersion
time, led to greater resistance and permanence of the print shape, which could adversely
affect the biodegradability of the printed hydrogels. Therefore, in order to reduce the
excessive tribological qualities (durability) [ 25,32], and also to minimize its possible toxic-
ity [24,25,32], the low concentration of glutaraldehyde was assessed. The 3Gel4 and 2.5Gel3
hydrogels crosslinked with 0.3 v/v% GTA for 3 h resulted in the best stability in PBS and
DMEM at 37C (Table 2), maintaining their shape for over 48 h, not disintegrating even
after a week of immersion.

2.2. Characterization of 3D-Printed Hydrogel
2.2.1. Morphology
Figure 1 shows the images obtained by the morphological analysis of 1 cm2square
shapes obtained by extrusion bioprinting. A comparison of the different hybrid compos-
ites hydrogels showed that both 3Gel4 crosslinked and non-crosslinked have a deﬁned
shape compared to 2.5Gel3, which appears to be less viscous. These results showed that
xanthan gum is a good stabilizing agent, because the hydrogel with 3 w/v% of Gel without
crosslinker is able to maintain its print shape, which even improves after the immersion
in GTA.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 4 of 16

The evaluation of the water content of a hy drogel is required for many biomedical 
applications. The percentages of water in the hydrogels were similar to each other, inde-
pendently from the gelatin content (Figure 2). Moreover, the moisture values for both hy-
drogels were above 90%, as reported in th e literature for other hydrogels [13,32].

2.2.3. Swelling Test 
The swelling tests were carried out on 2.5Gel3 and 3Gel4 printed hydrogels cross-
linked and non-crosslinked. These prints containing 2.5 w/v% and 3 w/v% of gelatin, after 
one hour of submersion in deionized water, showed a swelling rate of 1110.25% ± 339 and 
423.17% ± 47.34 respectively ( p-value 0.02543), increasing after three hours of submersion 
until the sixth hour, where all the prints resu lted in being completely dissolved (Figure 
3a). On the other hand, crosslinked prints using 0.3% glutaraldehyde immersion for 3 h 
showed more stable and more resistant swelling in deionized water (Figure 3b). The swell-
ing rate of the hydrogel with 2.5 w/v% of Gel was of 489.70 ± 168.57% compared to 30.27± 
7.59% ( p-value 0.009199) of 3 w/v% Gel content. In Figure 3b, it is possible to observe that, 
after 24 h, the 2.5Gel3 had achieved a much higher swelling rate than hydrogel 3Gel4. 
Furthermore, the different crosslinked hydrogels were observed under the light micro-scope (Figure 4). The images reported in Figu re 4 confirm that the crosslinked prints con-
taining 3 w/v% Gel are more resistant to swelling.

the high solubility of gelatin in warm water causes rapid disintegration. However, the 
analysis of the crosslinked prints showed initial degradation for the 3Gel4 hydrogel after 10 days with a percentage of hydrolysis of 53.96 ± 18.01% ( p-value 0.007441) and after 14 
days of 24.41 ± 28.16% ( p = 0.005756) in water at 37 °C (Figure 5), while crosslinked 2.5

2.2.5. Porosity 
An initial porosity analysis, using the liquid displacement method (Figure 6), showed 
that the hydrogel containing 3 w/v% gelatin had a porosity of 30.82 ± 4.93%, while the 2.5 
w/v% gelatin hydrogel showed a porosity value of 64.04 ± 16.68% ( p = 0.02974). These 
results were compared with those obtained by morphological analysis of both hydrogels (Figure 7). Microscope images showed that the pore size in the 2.5Gel3 was greater than 
that observed in 3Gel4 (Figure 7b). Therefore, the morphological analysis does not confirm 
the results obtained by the liquid displaceme nt method (Figure 6), thus suggesting that 
the 2.5 w/v% Gel appeared more porous, as  the amount of ethanol embedded was high 
because of the larger pore size than in 3Gel 4 (Figure 7b). Moreover, the number of pores 
within a hydrogel is an important feature for cell encapsulation (Figure 7c). Finally, the 
morphological analysis showed that the 3Gel 4-printed hydrogel had a larger number of 
pores with a smaller size compared to that of 2.5Gel3, indicating that it could be used for 
cell encapsulation.

2.2.6. Enzymatic Degradation
Collagenase I is a common mammalian enzyme which is often used at a concentration
of 0.1% in cell analyses, including protein digestion and tissues separation [ 24]. Collagenase
I was used for the enzymatic degradation test, and the data obtained suggested that
degradation occurs after an initial period of partial swelling (after 1 h), followed by slow
and steady degradation (Figure 8a). After 2 h, the residual mass of the 2.5Gel3-printed
hydrogel was 93.47 6.21%, while the 3Gel4 hydrogel’s residual mass was 85.90 19.43%.
The degradation continued slowly over time, with no signiﬁcant differences between the
degradation rate of the 3Gel4 and 2.5Gel3 hydrogel (Figure 8b).

3. Discussion 
Three-dimensional bioprinting has drown a lot of attention in the field of modern 
medicine for tissue engineering and wound healing. Currently, most in vitro studies have 
been performed on 2D or 3D cell-culture models that are devoid of the structural com-
plexity and function of the native tissues that can be produce by using bioprinting. In fact, 
bioprinting offers a potential route to generate complex 3D biological constructs that are capable of mimicking the micr oenvironment of the native tissue and promoting physio-
logically relevant cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions. 
Shawan et al. [13] described the synthesis of Gel/Xnt hydrogels by using 3 w/v% or 5 
w/v% of gelatin and 0.6 w/v% xanthan gum and glutaraldehyde (0.5 v/v%) used as cross-
linker, and they tested Gel/Xnt hybrid composite hydrogels in experimental skin burn 
wounds in rats as effective wound-dressing materials. However, the bioprintability prop-
erties of the obtained hybrid composite hydrog els were not evaluated. In fact, the original 
hydrogel could not be 3D-printed, possibly du e to the low concentration of the Xnt result-
ing in low viscosity. 
Therefore, to increase the viscosity of the new Gel/Xnt hydrogels (Table 1), the evap-
oration of the solution was gradually induced,  instead of adding water during the synthe-
sis, as reported by Shawan et al. [13], as well as lowering the processing temperature (from 
85 °C to 60–70 °C). Furthermore, the print stability was achieved by adding glutaralde-hyde after printing. 
Gelatin is widely used in wound-healing applications [33–36], but one of the limita-
tions is its liquification at the normal temp erature (37 °C) for the human body [31]. To

well as xanthan gum. This is a stabilizer and a homogenizing agent [37], which, being a 
powder, also influences the viscosity of the hydrogel, extending the surface area and con-
tact points for the adhesion of water molecu les within the hydrated matrix. Thus, when

3. Discussion
Three-dimensional bioprinting has drown a lot of attention in the ﬁeld of modern
medicine for tissue engineering and wound healing. Currently, most in vitro studies
have been performed on 2D or 3D cell-culture models that are devoid of the structural
complexity and function of the native tissues that can be produce by using bioprinting.
In fact, bioprinting offers a potential route to generate complex 3D biological constructs
that are capable of mimicking the microenvironment of the native tissue and promoting
physiologically relevant cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions.
Shawan et al. [ 13] described the synthesis of Gel/Xnt hydrogels by using 3 w/v%
or 5 w/v% of gelatin and 0.6 w/v% xanthan gum and glutaraldehyde (0.5 v/v%) used
as crosslinker, and they tested Gel/Xnt hybrid composite hydrogels in experimental skin
burn wounds in rats as effective wound-dressing materials. However, the bioprintability
properties of the obtained hybrid composite hydrogels were not evaluated. In fact, the
original hydrogel could not be 3D-printed, possibly due to the low concentration of the Xnt
resulting in low viscosity.
Therefore, to increase the viscosity of the new Gel/Xnt hydrogels (Table 1), the evapo-
ration of the solution was gradually induced, instead of adding water during the synthesis,
as reported by Shawan et al. [ 13], as well as lowering the processing temperature (from
85Cto 60–70C). Furthermore, the print stability was achieved by adding glutaraldehyde
after printing.
Gelatin is widely used in wound-healing applications [ 33–36], but one of the limita-
tions is its liquiﬁcation at the normal temperature (37C) for the human body [ 31]. To
overcome this drawback, it is possible to use stabilizers, thickeners and crosslinkers, as
well as xanthan gum. This is a stabilizer and a homogenizing agent [ 37], which, being
a powder, also inﬂuences the viscosity of the hydrogel, extending the surface area and
contact points for the adhesion of water molecules within the hydrated matrix. Thus, whenInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 10 of 16
lower amounts of xanthan gum or gelatin were used in hydrogels (Table 1), a decrease
in print-shape retention was observed. On the contrary, higher amounts of gelatin and
xanthan gum provided a higher shape retention, but, in addition to xanthan gum, glu-
taraldehyde is also needed for the gelatin crosslinking process and to maintain the print
shape (Table 2). Morphologic analysis demonstrated that the amount of the xanthan gum
as glutaraldehyde is important for the stabilization of the hybrid composite hydrogel. Lii
et al. [ 38] reported that Xnt and Gel interact by hydrogen-bonding, involving the -OH
groups and -NH 2groups of xanthan gum and gelatin, respectively, forming many bridges
to which water molecules can adhere within the matrix, thus increasing the contact surface
for water. In this regard, probably the concentration of 1.2 w/v% Xnt is higher than that of
a low amount of gelatin (2.5 w/v%). A greater number of bonds between hydroxyl groups
of the excess xanthan gum, not linked to gelatin, and water molecules cause an increase of
hydration during the synthesis of the hydrogel, and therefore a lower viscosity.
Furthermore, observing the images obtained under the microscope and shown in
Figure 1, we see that the non-crosslinked and crosslinked prints with glutaraldehyde
respectively showed a color change from white to pale yellow, as is typically associated
with the crosslinking reaction [39,40].
The human body is known to be largely composed of water. The main goal of this
work is the 3D printing of the cell-seeded hydrogel during therapies such as skin grafts [ 41]
to repair one or more layer of tissue [ 42] or to accelerate the wound healing. In particular,
hydrogel-like materials used for wound healing should have a high percentage of water, be-
cause it could improve the interaction between cells and diffusion of molecules [ 13] without
dehydration of the tissues. In both hydrogels, 2.5Gel3 and 3Gel4, the percentage of water is
around 90%, suggesting that these materials could be used in biomedical applications.
Furthermore, swelling is also an important property to evaluate. Swelling is the ability
of a hydrogel to absorb water, gaining weight and volume [ 25]. Hydrogels with higher
swelling values are more likely to change shape and break in hydrated environments. The
results of the hydrogels swelling rate may depend on the concentration of gelatin and the
presence of glutaraldehyde in their composition. The crosslinking of gelatin is due to the
reaction of the aldehyde functional groups present in the glutaraldehyde molecule with free
non-protonated "-amino groups (-NH 2) of lysine or hydroxylysine belonging to the gelatin.
This leads to the formation of amide linkages [ 43,44]. The linkages between the crosslinker
and the hydrogel matrix during the crosslinking reactions affect the water-retention ability
of the hydrogel [ 25]. This process can be observed with 3 w/v% Gel. Probably, since the
functional groups of the gelatin are involved in the bonds with all aldehyde groups of
the crosslinker, the latter cannot be involved in the bonds with the water molecules, thus
positively inﬂuencing the swelling rate. On the other hand, when the 2.5 w/v% of Gel and
0.3 v/v% of GTA were used, the number of functional groups of Gel was not enough to bind
all the aldehyde groups of the crosslinker, thus allowing a higher swelling. Comparing the
swelling and hydrolysis results, we see that the crosslinked 3 w/v% gelatin hydrogel was
resistant to swelling but sensible to the hydrolysis process. This could be due to a strong
crosslinking of the 3Gel4 hydrogel with 0.3 v/v% GTA. For this reason, many aldehyde
groups are linked to gelatin through an amide, bond and, therefore, they are less stable and
more subject to the hydrolysis reaction compared to 2.5Gel3, thus allowing for a greater
hydrogel degradation at high temperature by solvation and rapid disintegration of the
gelatin [39,45].
The size and number of pores, their connectivity and geometry are the main char-
acteristics for the use of the hydrogels in biomedical applications. Indeed, the ability of
cells to proliferate into a 3D structure is affected by the size of the pores, as well as is the
biodegradability of the structure itself [ 46]. In particular, to allow for vascularization and
tissue formation, pore sizes should be less than 500 m, as larger pore sizes could decrease
cell–cell interaction and, thus, their proliferation [ 46,47]. The 3Gel4 has a greater number
of smaller pores, probably due to the strong bond with the crosslinker that makes this
material denser and, therefore, gives it a better porosity compared to 2.5Gel3.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 11 of 16
The results of the enzymatic degradation and hydrolysis test showed the biodegrad-
ability of the produced hydrogel. Although crosslinked gelatin hydrogels are soft materials,
they are capable of causing irritation and reactions [ 24]. For this reason, the synthesized
Gel/Xnt hydrogel does not need to be highly resistant to degradation, thus allowing host
cells to gradually replace the hydrogel in wound healing and absorbing it completely.
Finally, human ﬁbroblast and keratinocytes were mixed with 2.5Gel3 and 3Gel4 hy-
drogels respectively, and a skin-like structure was printed to evaluate the biocompatibility
of both materials. The images of the cell distribution and proliferation in the hydrogels
collected after 1, 7 and 14 days in culture showed a good proliferation. These results are
also due to the presence of numerous and small pores that induce greater cell prolifera-
tion in a 3D structure [ 46] and to the good biodegradability of the material composing
the hydrogels.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Hydrogel Preparation
Shawan et al. [ 13] reported the preparation of the hydrogels by using different formula-
tions of gelatin (Gel), namely 3 w/v% and 5 w/v%, and 0.6 w/v% of xanthan gum (Xnt) for
heal ulcers. Based on this work, new compositions of Gel/Xnt hybrid composite hydrogels
were designed, modifying the ratio between two components to obtain the best printable
hydrogel. Bovine gelatin (Gel) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was slowly added
to deionized water at 70C, under magnetic stirring to avoid the formation of clumps.
Afterward, xanthan gum (Xnt) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added into the
gelatin solution, and the temperature was maintained between 60 and 70C until water
evaporation. Hydrogel was then stored at 4C until use. The formulations used to produce
the different hydrogels are reported in Table 1.
4.2. Bioprinting
Hydrogel Bioprinting
CellInk Inkredible 3D printer (CellInk Inkredible 3-D printer, CellInk, Gothenburg,
Sweden) was used for the hydrogel printing. Hydrogels were printed to obtain 1 cm2
squares. After preparation, hydrogels were left at 4C from 3 to 10 days, and they were
warmed to room temperature before printing. Bio-ink syringes (3 mL) were ﬁlled with
the different hydrogels and then loaded into the 3D printer. Printability trials were run at
different pressures (from 10 to 20 kPa), as reported in Table 1.
4.3. Hydrogel Crosslinking
Crosslinking trials were performed by using different concentrations of glutaraldehyde
(GTA, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 v/v%,) obtained from a 25 v/v% stock solution. In addition, for
each concentration, different submersion times in the glutaraldehyde solution (1 or 3 h)
were tested. The crosslinking of a hydrogel structure occurs in the post-printing process.
Crosslinked hydrogels were added to cell culture Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) to test their stability (Table 2).
4.4. Characterization of 3D-Printed Hydrogel
4.4.1. Morphology
The macroscopic morphology of the hydrogel was observed by taking several photos,
using a high-resolution digital camera (NIKON D5600). Optimal cutting temperature com-
pound (OCT compound) was used to incorporate the hydrogels prior to frozen sectioning
on a microtome cryostat, obtaining hydrogel micron slices. The optical reverse microscope
(Motic AE2000, Motic Europe, Barcelona, Spain) was used to evaluate the microscopic
morphology of the different printed hydrogels, both crosslinked and non-crosslinked.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 12 of 16
4.4.2. Moisture
The moisture percentage was measured as described by Shawan et al. [ 13]. On day 3
of stabilization, hydrated prints were weighted ( WH), stored at 37C for 2 days to allow the
drying process to be completed and then weighed again (WD). The percentage of moisture
(water) in a printed hydrogel was calculated as follows (Equation (1)):
Moisture (%) = [(WH WD)/WH]100 (1)
where WHis original weight of the sample before drying, and WDis weight of the sample
after drying. All the experiments were replicated three times, with at least three samples
for each condition.
4.4.3. Swelling Test
Printed hydrogel, both non-crosslinked and crosslinked, were dried at 37C for 48 h
to perform the swelling test [ 25]. Dried printed hydrogels were weighed, rehydrated by
soaking in deionized water and weighed again after the water was removed, at different
time points (time 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 h). The residual water was eliminated, using ﬁlter
paper, by capillary action. The swelling ratio (S) [ 25] was calculated by using the following
equation (Equation (2)):
S = [(WH WD)/WD]100. (2)
where WHis sample hydrated weight, and WDis initial dehydrated weight.
All the experiments were replicated three times, with at least three samples for
each condition.
4.4.4. Hydrolysis
In order to evaluate the hydrolysis, crosslinked printed hydrogels were weighed
(time 0 ) and immersed in deionized water at 37C. After the time point from 4 to 14 days,
the weight of the crosslinked prints was taken by removing the deionized water and lightly
dabbing the crosslinked prints with ﬁlter paper. The percentage of hydrolysis was obtained
by using the following equation (Equation (3)):
Hydrolysis (%) = [(WI WF)/WI]100 (3)
where WIis the before soaking weight, and WFis the remaining weight after soaking and
removing of the deionized water. All the experiments were replicated three times, with at
least three samples for each condition.
4.4.5. Porosity
The porosity of the printed hydrogels was evaluated by using the liquid displacement
method [ 24]. Absolute ethanol, which causes neither swelling nor shrinking of gelatin [ 24],
was used for prints’ submersion. After 5 min of submersion in a known quantity of absolute
ethanol, samples were weighed. The porosity of the hydrogel was calculated as follows
(Equation (4)):
Porosity (%) = [(W 1 W3)/(W 2 W3)]100 (4)
where W 1is the initial weight of pure ethanol, W 2is the total weight that combines the
weight of the hydrogel with the weight of the ethanol and W 3is the ending weight of
ethanol without hydrogel [24].
Furthermore, Greyscale 8-bit TIFF images of the 2.5Gel3 and 3Gel4 were processed by
using ImageJ software. The ImageJ “particle analysis” function was then used to calculate
the size and the numerosity of hydrogel pores. All the experiments were replicated three
times, with at least three samples for each condition.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 13 of 16
4.4.6. Enzymatic Degradation
The biological stability of the hydrogels was evaluated by exposing them to 0.1% colla-
genase type IA (>125 CDU/mg, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to assess degradation
rates [ 24]. Printed hydrogels were dried at 37C for two days, and before the analysis,
the dry prints were soaked in PBS for 1 h, and then they were exposed to the enzymatic
solution (prepared in PBS 1X) at 0.1% collagenase type I for 6 h. Enzymatic degradation
tests [ 24] were performed at 37C in a horizontal shaker. After different time points (1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6 h), the excess water was removed from the printed hydrogels and then weighed.
The biomaterial degradation was determined by calculating the percentage of remaining
weight versus the original weight. All the experiments were replicated three times, with at
least three samples for each condition.
4.5. Cell Culture
Primary human-derived-skin ﬁbroblasts and human keratnocytes spontaneously im-
mortalized (HaCaTs) were used for testing printable hydrogels biocompatibility. HaCaTs
were purchased from Cell Lines Service GmbH (Eppelheim, Germany), while human ﬁ-
broblasts were a kind gift from Professor Marco De Andrea (University of Turin, Turin,
Italy). Both cell types were grown in culture ﬂask in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) containing high glucose levels supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin (all from Immunological Science,
Rome, Italy) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO 2at 37C. Two different cell
populations (keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts) inserted into the two hydrogels of different
porosity were used for printing a simple 3D skin-like model with a surface layer that
mimics the epidermis (high cell concentration for the epithelium) and a lower layer that
mimics the dermis (low cellular concentration for the connective). The 2.5Gel3 and 3Gel4
printable hydrogels were gently mixed with 0.5 106ﬁbroblasts/mL and 5 106HaCaT
cells/mL, respectively, using two syringes connected under a sterile cap. Small cylinders
(0.5 cm high, 1 cm wide) were printed by using cell-laden 2.5Gel3 for the lower layers and
3Gel4 for the upper layers. The cylinders were crosslinked by using GTA as previously
indicated. The cell-laden cylinders were washed three times with sterile PBS and incubated
for 1, 7 and 14 days in DMEM 10% FBS at 37C in a 5% CO 2atmosphere. At the end of the
incubation time, the culture medium was removed, and the hydrogels containing the cells
were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 3 times, formalin ﬁxed and parafﬁn
embedded. Samples were then cut in 5 slices and stained with hematoxylin/eosin; the
cells grown in hydrogels were observed by using a digitizer Pannoramic Midi for micro-
scope slides (Epredia, Palermo, Italy), and their number was evaluated by using the ImageJ
software. All the experiments were replicated three times, with at least three samples for
each condition.
4.6. Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were
performed by using GraphPad PRISM software. Kolmogorov–Smirnoff test was applied
to verify the normal distribution of data. One-way ANOVA was employed for multiple
comparison, the whereas t-test was used when a comparison between two group occurred.
Thep-values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
5. Conclusions
The hybrid composite hydrogels containing different percentages of gelatin and the
same amount of xanthan gum were designed to obtain printable materials for in vitro
and in vivo biomedical applications. Among all the hydrogel formulations modulating
the process and the parameters of the 3D printer, the 2.5 w/v% and 3 w/v% of gelatin
with 1.2 w/v% xanthan gum resulted in being printable, with a good resolution. The
characterization results showed that 3Gel/4hydrogel crosslinked with 0.3 v/v% GTA
presents optimal properties compared to the hydrogel with 2.5Gel3. In particular, the 3Gel4Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022 ,23, 539 14 of 16
hybrid composite hydrogel was able to maintain its print shape, to resist to the swelling
and to degrade easily. Moreover, it shares a very good biocompatibility with the 2.5Gel3,
and it could be used as a matrix for cell growth, for the development of in vitro tissues or
also for wound dressing, allowing the host cells to gradually replace the hydrogel with a
secreted matrix.

Process development ABSTRACT  
The generation of artificial human tissue by 3D-bioprinting has expanded significantly as a clinically relevant 
research topic in recent years. However, to produce a complex and viable tissue, in-depth biological under -
standing and advanced printing techniques are required with a high number of process parameters. Here, we 
systematically evaluate the process parameters relevant for a hybrid bioprinting process based on fused- 
deposition modeling (FDM) of thermoplastic material and microextrusion of a cell-laden hydrogel. First, we 
investigated the effect of the printing temperature of polycaprolactone (PCL), on the junction strength between 
individual fused filaments and on the viability of immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSC) in the sur-
rounding alginate-gelatin-hydrogel. It was found that a printing temperature of 140 •C and bonds with an angle 
of 90•between the filaments provided a good compromise between bonding strength of the filaments and the 
viability of the surrounding cells. Using these process parameters obtained from individual fused filaments, we 
then printed cubic test structures with a volume of 10 ×10 ×10 mm3 with different designs of infill patterns. 
The variations in mechanical strength of these cubes were measured for scaffolds made of PCL-only as well as for 
hydrogel-filled PCL scaffolds printed by alternating hybrid bioprinting of PCL and hydrogel, layer by layer. The 
bare scaffolds showed a compressive modulus of up to 6 MPa, close to human hard tissue, that decreased to about 
4 MPa when PCL was printed together with hydrogel. The scaffold design suited best for hybrid printing was 
incubated with cell-laden hydrogel and showed no degradation of its mechanical strength for up to 28 days.   
1.Introduction 
3D-bioprinting has become a significant research area in the last 
years and shows great potential for future applications in regenerative 
medicine (Cui et al., 2017 ; Keriquel et al., 2010 ; Murphy and Atala, 
2014 ) and in vitro models (Arslan-Yildiz et al., 2016 ; Mandrycky et al., 
2016 ). For both applications, extrusion-based bioprinting is with 76% 
the most frequently reported bioprinting technology (Pedroza-Gonz ˘alez 
et al., 2021 ) to print cells and other biomaterials (Choudhury et al., 
2018 ) (Ozbolat and Hospodiuk, 2016 ). Its low cost and ease of use are 
particularly advantageous compared to, for example, laser-based 
methods (Guillotin et al., 2010 ; Seol et al., 2014 ). Compared to drop-on-demand bioprinting, where low viscous fluids are printed as 
droplets (Binder et al., 2011 ; Troendle et al., 2021 ), a compromise of 
mechanically stable biomaterials is found that allows printing into the 
third dimension while ensuring sufficient cell viability (Heid and Boc-
caccini, 2020 ; Malda et al., 2013 ). 
Although the processes and materials for extrusion-based bioprinting 
are becoming more and more advanced, the mechanical stabilities of 
hydrogels are still far from those of human hard tissue. One way to 
improve mechanical stability without reducing cell viability by 
increased hydrogel stiffness is to decouple the mechanical and biological 
requirements. This can be achieved by combining several materials in a 
multi-material bioprinting process referred to also as hybrid bioprinting

2process. For this purpose, a stiff material that supports the mechanical 
load can be combined with a softer material that serves as an extracel -
lular matrix (Kang et al., 2016 ; Ruiz-Cantu et al., 2020 ). 
Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a biodegradable polymer that has been 
extensively studied in the biomedical field due to its excellent me-
chanical stability and bio-compatibility (Endres et al., 2003 ; Schage -
mann et al., 2010 ). A broad use of PCL has already been reported for 
fabrication of scaffolds for a wide range of tissues, such as nerve (Ciar-
delli and Chiono, 2006 ; Woodruff and Hutmacher, 2010 ), cartilage 
(Alves da Silva, M L et al., 2010 ; Woodruff and Hutmacher, 2010 ) and, 
bone (Hutmacher et al., 2001 ; Ren et al., 2017 ; Woodruff and Hut-
macher, 2010 ). Hutmacher (Hutmacher et al., 2001 ) and Zein (Zein 
et al., 2002 ) were among the first groups to use fused deposition 
modeling (FDM) to generate porous PCL scaffolds, which can be incu-
bated with cells. They investigated the compression modulus and other 
mechanical properties of the scaffolds and demonstrated the great po-
tential of such PCL scaffolds for medical applications. Novel PCL-based 
composite materials loaded with organic or inorganic fillers can help to 
control mechanical properties and integrate further functionalities 
(Maietta et al., 2018 ). Such hybrid PCL-based scaffolds have been shown 
to be suitable for long-term in vitro cultivation of up to 4 weeks with 
high stability (Lee et al., 2010 ). 
For 3D-objects thicker than a few millimeters, it can also be of great 
advantage to incorporate porosity in the printed scaffolds through 
intercalated microchannels made of cell-laden hydrogel and PCL. The 
remaining porosity allows for better diffusion in vitro and in vivo to 
reduce tissue necrosis (Kang et al., 2016 ). For printing PCL in combi -
nation with cell-laden hydrogel, shear-thinning rheological properties of 
the hydrogel are desirable (Paxton et al., 2017 ). This allows the printing 
of high viscous hydrogels with low shear stress. Immediately after 
printing, the hydrogel should have maximum stability, and not disin-
tegrate from its printed shape. 
It has already been shown that compression moduli up to 6 MPa can 
be achieved (Schuurman et al., 2011 ). This is in the range of natural 
tissue, such as cartilage with 4.1 MPa (Woodfield et al., 2004 ) or trachea 
with 3.3 MPa (Trabelsi et al., 2010 ). The molecular weight and filament 
diameter of the PCL, the fiber orientation and the pore size were 
important factors to influence the mechanical properties of printed 
scaffolds. In general, an increase in porosity led to a decrease in elastic 
properties (Moroni et al., 2006 ). 
In summary, multi-material bioprinting processes have already been 
used to fabricate tissue-like structures and demonstrated their added 
value for regenerative medicine. However, multi-material bioprinting 
requires the use of different printing technologies and biomaterials, 
leading to increasingly complex and costly printing systems and pro-
cesses. To enable such processes, we have equipped in our previous work 
a low-cost open-source FDM 3D-printer with an additional syringe 
extruder for the alternate processing of thermoplastics and cell-laden 
hydrogels in a single process (Koch et al., 2021 ). However, the pro-
cesses presented here can be implemented with any 3D bioprinter that 
has at least one printhead for printing thermoplastics and one printhead 
for extruding cell-laden hydrogels. The number of possible process 
variations can increase exponentially with the number of different ma-
terials and printing methods. In order to vary only relevant parameters, 
a systematic investigation of the printing temperature as first parameter 
can be helpful, because the FDM extrusion temperature affects both: the 
bond strength between the filaments and the cell viability, alike. To 
date, the printing temperature in hybrid-bioprinting has not been sys-
tematically investigated regarding its influence on bond strength of 
filament junctions and cell survival in the surrounding hydrogel. Mostly 
only successful printing designs have been presented in the literature 
(Kang et al., 2016 ; Schuurman et al., 2011 ) without showing how the 
printing temperature and other parameters were optimized. 
Here, we present a systematic investigation of the printing temper -
ature of FDM-printed PCL on the mechanical compressibility and the cell 
viability of the surrounding cells. First, fracture forces in simple PCL test structures were investigated in order to determine suitable printing 
parameter settings. Based on these findings, four different infill patterns 
were printed and evaluated for their mechanical strength as stability- 
promoting porous PCL scaffolds when printed as bare structures from 
PCL only and when combined with cell-laden alginate-gelatin hydrogel. 
The mechanically most promising design was then used to investigate 
the influence of hydrogel and incubation conditions on the mechanical 
stability of the printed part after up to 28 day of incubation. The final use 
case for such hybrid designs with high mechanical stability made from 
PCL and cell laden hydrogels might be in the field of fabrication of 
regenerative bone tissues as stability-promoting scaffolds or bone 
replacement implants. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Bioprinter and characterization 
A commercial 3D-printer Prusa i3 MK3 from Prusa Research A.S 
(Prague, Czech Republic) was used as a bioprinter platform. The FDM 
printer was upgraded with an extrusion printhead to allow alternate 
printing of hydrogel and thermoplastic material in a single process. The 
final printer design and the complete instructions for making, assem -
bling and operating the printer are documented in an open access 
publication (Koch et al., 2021 ). In all experiments polycaprolactone 
(PCL) Facilian PCL100 from 3D4Makers B.V. (Haarlem, Netherlands) 
with 50,000 g/mol and 1.75 mm filament diameter was printed using a 
0.4 mm nozzle by E3D-Online (Oxfordshire, UK). The fracture force of 
the bonds between the PCL filaments was tested by pulling the filaments 
with the bond tester Dage 4000 from Dage (Feldkirch, Germany). 
Compression modulus was measured with a compression test machine 
EZ-SX from Shimadzu Europe (Duisburg, Germany). Each sample was 
compressed with 1 mm/min loading speed until 30% strain to reach the 
plastic region. Due to plastic deformation, the measurements could only 
be performed once per sample. Compression modulus was defined as the 
slope of the linear region of the stress/strain curve. The linear region was 
in different ranges for the tested scaffolds, but always between 5% and 
10% strain. For the hydrogel-only samples, which were significantly less 
stable due to the absence of PCL, the linear region was defined from 0% 
to 10%. 
For visualization of the PCL scaffolds, PhotoView 360 from Solid -
works 2017 from Dassault Systˇemes (V˘elizy-Villacoublay, France) was 
used. The GCode was generated with PrusaSlicer version 2.1.1 based on 
Slic3r from Prusa Research A.S (Prague, Czech Republic). The porosity 
of the PCL scaffolds was calculated with the following equation 
porosity1 mscaffold
ρPCL⋅Vscaffold⋅100% (1)  
where mscaffold is the weighted mass of the scaffold, ρPCL the constant 
density of PCL of 1.1 g/cm3 as specified by the manufacturer, and 
Vscaffold the optically measured volume of the scaffold. The number of 
bonding errors was determined by visually inspecting at least 10 scaf-
folds and manually counting the visible number of broken or missing 
bonds. Images for the optical volume determination were acquired using 
a digital microscope Dino-Lite Premier from AnMo Electronics (Hsinchu, 
Taiwan). For each scaffold design, at least three samples were measured 
at five representatively selected lengths along each dimension. 
2.2. Bioink 
The hydrogel was prepared by dissolving 4 w/v% alginate A1112- 
100G and 16 w/v% gelatin 39465-500G both from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, United States) in PBS each. Gelatin solution was heated up to 
80 •C and alginate stirred for 24 h without heating to dissolve fully. Both 
stock solutions were mixed 1:1 to result in a hydrogel with 2 w/v% 
alginate and 8 w/v% gelatin. The bioink was filled in 2 ml medical F. Koch et al.

3syringes from BBraun (Melsungen, Germany) and printed with conical 
dispensing nozzles from Globaco GmbH (Rodermark, Germany) with an 
inner diameter of 410 μm. The hydrogel was cross-linked by incubating 
for 30 s in a 10% CaCl 2 (223506) solution from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, 
United States) dissolved in water. A cell-laden hydrogel was prepared by 
gently mixing cells in a concentration of 500,000 cells/ml into the 37 •C 
warm hydrogel. 
2.3. Cell culture 
Immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) were kindly provided 
by Prof. Dr. Matthias Schieker from the Laboratory of Experimental 
Surgery and Regenerative Medicine of the Ludwig-Maximilians- 
University of Munich. They were immortalized by lentiviral gene 
transfer of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (Bocker et al., 2008 ). 
The cells were cultivated in MEM alpha Medium including 10% FBS 
both from Gibco (Carlsbad, USA) at 37 •C and 5% CO2. 
2.4. Live/dead assay 
Cell viability was determined with a viability/cytotoxicity kit for 
mammalian cells (Invitrogen L3224) from Fisher Scientific GmbH 
(Schwerte, Germany). Cells were stained as recommended in the pro-
tocol for 30 min and imaged with a fluorescence microscope Observer 
Z1 microscope from Carl Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) with 470 nm and 
555 nm excitation wavelength. Image analysis was performed with 
ImageJ (V1.52). Since the cells were due to extrusion printing randomly 
distributed in the hydrogel rather than in a single focal plane, an in-
tensity threshold was defined in each image. Values higher than 70% of 
the maximum intensity were defined as valid live or dead fluorescence 
signals, as described in detail in a previous publication (Koch et al., 
2020 ). All quantitative data were assessed for statistical significance by performing an ANOVA with a Tukey post-hoc test. A statistically sig-
nificant test result was considered for p D0.05. 
3.Results and discussion 
First, the hybrid bioprinter was characterized for its properties using 
only the FDM-printhead. For the subsequent hybrid printing of porous 
structures, which may contain cell-laden material, it was of general in-
terest to determine how the PCL printing temperature influences the 
mechanical stability of the bond between single fused filaments and the 
viability of the surrounding cells. Therefore, a test structure was 
designed with a single filament printed at an angle of 90•to the previous 
layers. The filament bridged a distance of 2 mm between the two pre-
vious layers. Detailed images of the test structure are shown in the 
supplemental Fig. A1. The printing temperature was gradually increased 
by 10 •C between 100 •C and 180 •C. For each temperature at least 44 
samples were investigated by pulling up the filament in the pull tester 
until failure and measuring the fracture force. Supplemental Fig. A2 il-
lustrates the pull tester with a test structure and the two failure mech -
anisms that occur (bond and filament break). 
Fig. 1a shows the mean fracture force obtained from these pull tests 
as a function of the temperature. The fracture force increases from 
around 2.5 N to around 4.5 N for increasing printing temperature from 
100 •C to 140 •C. For temperatures above 140 •C, no significant change 
in fracture force was measured. This may result from a changed failure 
mechanism, as shown in Fig. 1b. For increasing temperature, the failure 
mechanism changed from breakage of the bond between the two fila-
ments (bond break) to breakage of the filaments itself (filament break). 
An increasing number of filament breaks indicates that the fracture force 
has increased close to the maximum fracture force given by the material 
properties (see also supplemental Fig. A3 in which the bond break and 
filament break were considered individually). 
Fig. 1.Influence of nozzle temperature and raster angle on the mechanical stability of fused filaments and cell viability during FDM printing of PCL. Fracture force 
was measured by pulling on a bridging filament connected to two filaments below. The temperature was varied between 100 •C and 180 •C (a) Failure was analyzed 
and sorted into two categories, either the separation of two layers on joints (bond break) or the breakage of the filament itself (filament break) (b). Fracture force was 
measured for angles of 90•, 45•, and 30 •between the fused filaments (c). Cell viability was determined for cells embedded into a hydrogel of alginate and gelatin and 
injected below the printed filament (d). F. Koch et al.

4In addition to the influence of the printing temperature, the fila-
ment ’s angle on the contact points was also investigated. This raster 
angle between the filaments in contact to each other was varied from 90•
to 45•and 30•. The resulting fracture force was measured for 50 fused 
filaments for each angle in the range from 130 •C to 150 •C and is shown 
in Fig. 1c. It can be seen that the fracture force significantly decreases 
with reduced raster angle. This may be due to a smaller area interacting 
with shear forces when the raster angle is reduced. Thus, all junctions 
between fused filaments printed with angles unequal to 90•should 
result in a lower bond strength. This finding is also in line with most 
published experiments on similar test structures in 3D-bioprinting 
(Hutmacher et al., 2001 ; Zein et al., 2002 ). Based on the measure -
ments shown in Fig. 1c, only a raster angle of 90•was used for the 
subsequent experiments. 
The printing temperature does not only affect the cohesive strength 
between the filaments but also influences the viability of the sur-
rounding cells. To achieve a high mechanical stability between the fil-
aments on the one hand, the printing temperature should be selected as 
high as possible up to 150 •C. At temperatures between 150 •C and 
180 •C, a plateau is reached and the fracture force does not increase any 
further, as shown in Fig. 1a. On the other hand, the printing temperature 
should generally be as low as possible for the printing process with living 
cells, because the printed PCL filaments will heat up the surrounding 
hydrogel and thus might damage the cells. In the experiments carried 
out to investigate this effect, PCL filaments were printed in straight lines 
at a federate of 10 mm/s directly onto an approximately 1 mm thick 
crosslinked cell-laden hydrogel with different nozzle temperatures. 
Immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) were encapsulated in a 
hydrogel of 2% alginate and 8% gelatin in a concentration of 500,000 
cells/ml. Cell viability was assessed with a live/dead assay at ten regions 
of interest and is shown for different nozzle temperatures in Fig. 1d. The 
viability remains between 60% and 70% for increasing temperature up 
to 140 •C and decreases for higher temperatures to viabilities down to 
40%. The viability in control samples without contact to heated PCL 
filaments had a viability of 72% ±17%. 
From these measurements of the fracture force and the cell viability 
both being influenced by the printing temperature, it was decided for all 
further experiments to choose a printing temperature of 140 •C and print 
only connections with a raster angle of 90•between the fused filaments 
to achieve highest stability and viability. Beyond a temperature of 
140 •C, an increase in printing temperature would not result in a further 
increase in fracture force and a reduction of printing temperature would 
not result in a significant increase in cell viability. 
In addition to the influence of the individual bonds between fused 
filaments on the mechanical stability, the print design plays a role in the 
structure ’s overall mechanical stability. Based on the results related to temperature and raster angle, four different scaffold designs were 
printed at 140 •C and 90•raster angle between fused filaments. The four 
scaffold designs, shown in Table 1, had a similar mass and dimensions of 
10 ×10 ×10 mm3. Therefore, the theoretical porosity was between 
71.5% and 71.6% and a slightly higher porosity between 74.0% and 
75.9% was calculated according to equation (1) based on experimental 
weighing results. The deviation of these values from the theoretical 
measured porosity may be due to a systematic loss of mass during 
printing, a discrepancy in the density specification of the PCL from the 
manufacturer, deviations from the ideal cubic volume or a combination 
of these. The designs were chosen so that the porosity is as similar as 
possible but with varied maximum pore sizes. Scaffold 1 was chosen as 
the most straightforward print design with alternating filaments in x- 
and y-direction, forming 90•junctions with the following layer. For each 
layer, seven lines are printed as a meander. The pore sizes are uniform 
and with 0.53 mm3, the smallest of the four scaffolds. In scaffolds 2 and 
3, gradients in the x- and y-positions of the filaments were created, 
resulting in bigger maximum pore sizes in the center of the scaffolds of 
1.52 mm3 and 2.92 mm3, respectively. This is in reference to natural 
tissue where, for example in bones, most of the mechanical load is 
absorbed by the outer walls of the structure and therefore allows the 
center to be more porous and suitable for vascularization. The gradient 
increases from scaffold 2 to scaffold 3, so that scaffold 3 has a solid outer 
wall. Scaffold 4 is identical to scaffold 1 but has twice the maximum pore 
size of 1.06 mm3 because double layers with the same orientation are 
printed on top of each other. 
These four scaffolds were tested for their mechanical stability with a 
compression test. The compression modulus was determined as the 
linear region in the stress/strain diagram for a compression speed of 1 
mm/s. It can be seen in Fig. 2a, that the mechanical stability of the 
scaffolds barely differs despite the different maximum pore sizes. All 
scaffolds had an average compression modulus of about 6 MPa for ten 
tested scaffolds each. A significant difference could only be observed 
between scaffold 3 and scaffold 4. Although the scaffolds were of similar 
porosity and mechanical stability, the occurrence of errors during the 
printing process was different. Errors were defined as not fused fila-
ments in the z-direction. If this junction was not bonded, it could not 
support any load and was easily displaced in x- and y-direction. The total 
number of bonding errors was counted for each scaffold and shown in 
Fig. 2b. Since scaffold 2 had a significantly higher number of errors than 
scaffold 1 and scaffold 4, it was not considered for further experiments 
with cells. The design of scaffold 3 would prevent diffusion of nutrients 
during in vitro cultivation due to the solid outer walls and as it exhibited 
no superior compressive modulus than scaffolds 1 and 4 it was also 
excluded from further experiments. (Exemplary images of the bonding 
errors are shown in supplemental Fig. A4 for each scaffold). 
Table 1 
Overview of various PCL scaffold designs used for mechanical testing. Scaffolds 1–4 were designed to have similar porosity but different maximum pore sizes. The pore 
sizes are increased in scaffold 2 and 3 by creating a gradient of horizontally aligned layers from the center to the outside of the structures, ending in a closed solid wall 
surrounding scaffold 3. The pore sizes are increased in scaffold 4 by using the same filament spacing like in scaffold 1, but printing two identical layers on top of each 
other each time.

5Scaffold 1 and scaffold 4 were investigated further by measurements 
of their compression modulus in the x- and y-direction, as shown in 
Fig. 2c. The compression modulus in the x- and y-direction was 
compared to the values in the z-direction, as already shown in Fig. 2a. 
Both scaffolds showed significantly higher compression moduli in the x- 
and y-direction than in the z-direction, increasing from about 6 MPa to 
about 8 MPa. Furthermore, the influence of the total number of fila-
ments in the x- and y-direction was investigated by experiments. For this 
purpose, the distance between the filaments in x- and y-direction of 
scaffolds 1 and 4 was increased, and thus, the total number of filaments 
was reduced from 84 to 60 and to 36 in both designs. This corresponds to 
a reduction of filaments perpendicular to the compression direction from 7 to 5 or 3 for each layer. The resulting compression moduli are 
shown in Fig. 2d. It can be seen that the compression modulus decreases 
linearly with a reduced number of filaments. At the same time, the 
porosity increases due to the lower number of filaments. Such mea-
surements allow to forecast the mechanical stability of a specific design 
and therefore to customize the scaffolds based on porosity and me-
chanical requirements. 
To study the interaction of the PCL printing process with the micro 
extrusion of hydrogel, the two scaffolds 1 and 4, previously rated with 
the highest compression moduli, were printed at a nozzle temperature of 
140 •C and in the same run hydrogel filaments were printed layer by

Scaffold 2 was excluded from the following experiments due to the high number and variation of errors (b), and scaffold 3 due to the design not suitable for in vitro 
incubation. Scaffolds 1 and 4 were investigated in detail by also measuring the compression modulus in x- and y-direction (c) and the increase in porosity due to the 
reduction of filaments aligned against compression from 84 down to 36 (n 3) (d).

6printing process the same volume of hydrogel as for the PCL was printed 
between the PCL filaments in each layer. Due to the additionally added 
hydrogel, the total porosity of the printed object decreased from about 
75% to about 50%. In Fig. 3a, the compression modulus of these hybrid 
structures (blue) was compared with the pure PCL scaffolds (gray). As 
further reference, a pure hydrogel cube with the same edge length as the 
other scaffolds was printed. The results of the pure hydrogel samples are 
shown for comparison (red), as well. Despite the maximum filling of the 
hydrogel cube (i.e. zero porosity), the hybrid PCL scaffolds are about 
150 times more stable than the pure hydrogel cube. 
It can be seen for both scaffold designs that mechanical stability 
decreases with the addition of hydrogel, despite the fact that the total 
number of PCL filaments is not reduced. The most likely explanation for 
the smaller compression moduli of the hybrid scaffolds might be the 
reduced bonding strength between fused PCL filaments caused by wet-
ting with hydrogel that leaks out from the hydrogel filaments. For 
scaffold 4, this reduction in compression modulus is lower than for 
scaffold 1. Since both hydrogel and PCL were printed with two identical 
layers on top of each other, the printing process appears to be less 
sensitive a reduction of the stability due to hybrid printing. Therefore, 
scaffold 4 was used in the following for the printing experiment with 
living cells suspended in the hydrogel. 
To investigate potential long-term degradation of PCL under real cell 
culture conditions, hybrid structures of scaffold 4 were printed with 
alginate-gelatin hydrogel laden with 500,000 iMSCs/ml. Structures 
were incubated in cell culture medium, which was changed every three 
days. Since cell viability is highly dependent on many parameters 
beyond the used print design, which was the focus of this investigation, 
cell viability was not systematically quantified within the experiment. 
However, cell proliferation observed on the bottom of the plates indi-
cated unrestricted cell viability in the presence of the PCL scaffolds 
throughout the whole experiment. Fig. 3b shows the compression 
modulus of two hybrid scaffolds after 0, 7, 14, and 28 days of incubation. 
Over the period of 28 days, only slight differences in the range of the 
previously determined standard deviation could be seen. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the compression moduli of PCL scaffolds deter -
mined previously are valid for up to 28 days of in vitro cultivation. Thus, 
hybrid printing of bioinks and porous PCL scaffolds can significantly 
increase the mechanical stability during an incubation period of at least 
up to four weeks. The increase of the compression modulus from the kPa 
to the MPa range is a significant improvement compared to the pure 
hydrogel-based bioink, which can be beneficial for in vivo applications of 
hard human tissues. 
4.Conclusions 
In this work, process parameters and printing patterns for hybrid 3D- 
bioprinting of PCL and a micro extruded alginate-gelatin-hydrogel were 
systematically investigated. It was shown that design parameters and 
printing parameters can be adjusted in view of a defined mechanical 
stability of the resulting 3D-bioprinted object. First, a systematic study 
showed the influence of PCL printing temperature on bond strength 
between PCL filaments and the viability of surrounding cells subjected to 
thermal stress by the PCL deposition. Second, four different printing 
designs were investigated by varying infill patterns. The designs were 
printed with a similar porosity, evaluated for their mechanical stability, 
and tested for hybrid printing. With the knowledge gained from the 
study, the final mechanical stability of the printed scaffolds can be 
predicted and adjusted by the chosen designs as a function of the 
number of printed PCL filaments. The mechanically most stable design 
was tested for its long-term stability as a hybrid print construct with a 
cell-laden hydrogel by incubation for up to 28 days. During this time no 
significant change in the mechanical stability was detected. 
The hybrid bioprinting process described in this work allows to 
achieve high mechanical stability, similar to human hard tissues, 
simultaneously with high cell viability in a single 3D-bioprinted object. Compared to the use of a one single bioink only, these properties are 
achieved by combining porous PCL structures with a hydrogel-based 
bioink, leading to a decoupling of the mechanical and cellular re-
quirements. But, also for the hybrid printing approach, a compromise 
between mechanical stability and cell viability must be made, which 
may differ for each material and application. The printing temperature 
of 140 •C and angles of 90•between filaments described here as most 
stable configuration for printing PCL, while still maintaining a high cell 
viability, may help for process optimization of other 3D-bioprinting 
processes, designs, cells and materials.

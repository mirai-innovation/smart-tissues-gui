alginate, and 2 mg/ml fibrinogen was chosen for 
subsequent bioprinting experiments.
 sntsplit:
In this work, based 
on these previous reports and in consideration of 
the desirable properties, a brand-new bio-ink that 
contains 5% (w/v) gelatin, 1% alginate, and 2 mg/ 
ml fibrinogen was selected through a great number 
of tests.
 sntsplit:
Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) 
were uniformly mixed in this bioink at 1 × 106 cells/mL concentration, and spheroid

Bioink preparation
Gelatin (Type B, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 
in 3 w/v % (0.3 g in 10 mL) was dissolved in Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, MA, USA) in a glass beaker at ~40°C while being 
magnetically stirred at 150 rpm.
 sntsplit:
After gelatin dissolution, 
sodium alginate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 3 
w/v % (0.3 g in 10 mL) was added to the gelatin solution 
and mixed overnight to obtain the AG hydrogel.
 sntsplit:
B3 glass 
powder particles (less than 20 µm with ~3 µm d50 particle 
size; chemical composition in wt.%: 53% B2O3, 20% CaO, 
12% K2O, 6% Na2O, 5% MgO, 4% P2O5) were added to the 
solution in four different weight ratios (0.075, 0.15, 0.3, and 
0.6 w/v %) after gelatin dissolution and allowed to dissolve 
for ~10 min before the addition of alginate powder.
 sntsplit:
For 
example, 0.075 w/v % B3 glass corresponds to 1.25% 
of total combined weight of alginate and gelatin in the 
solution.
 sntsplit:
Therefore, AG hydrogels made with 0.075, 0.15, 
0.3, and 0.6 w/v % B3 glass are referred as 1.25G, 2.5G, 5G, 
and 10G, respectively, in this paper.

Rheological characterization
For rheological characterization, hydrogels were prepared 
in deionized (DI) water with gelatin (3 w/v %), alginate 
(3 w/v %), and AG (6 w/v %), and with the addition of 
B3 glass in different weight concentrations.
 sntsplit:
These findings suggest 
the likelihood of an optimal B3 glass concentration, ranging 
between 1.25 and 2.5 wt.%, for AG hydrogels composed of 3 
w/v % alginate and 3 w/v % gelatin.
 sntsplit:
AG hydrogel 
strength greatly depends on the w/v % of the alginate and 
gelatin used in the preparation and the ionic strength of 
the crosslinking solution.
 sntsplit:
used 6 
w/v % of alginate and gelatin (compared to 3 w/v % used 
in our study), and the crosslinked samples with 0.3 M 
CaCl2 (compared to 0.1 M CaCl2 in our study) reported 
improved mechanical properties that were able to sustain 
for up to 7 days in culture conditions.14 Our attempts to 
test specimens after soaking them in DMEM for 7 days 
at culture conditions were not successful as specimens 
were broken in the grips of the Instron machine, and 
insignificant elastic modulus and strength values were 
recorded.
 sntsplit:
The ASC viability in spheroidal culture helped 
determine the range of viable B3 glass percentages that 
could be added to AG hydrogel (0.075 and 0.15 w/v % or 
1.25G and 2.5G gels) and the suitable culture conditions 
(dynamic better than static).
 sntsplit:
Rheological 
properties of an AG hydrogel were modified with the 
addition of 0.075 to 0.6 w/v % of highly resorbable B3 glass, 
and scaffolds were successfully fabricated.
 sntsplit:
The addition of 
B3 glass (0.075 and 0.15 w/v %) increased the viscosity 
(from 0.2 kPa·s to 7 kPa·s) and made the AG hydrogel exhibit a viscoelastic solid-like behavior (G’> G’’) that 
improved the hydrogel recovery and enabled effortless 
extrusion 3D printing of scaffolds.
 sntsplit:
Despite the toxicity of B3 to ASCs when 
added in quantities higher than 0.3 w/v % to hydrogel 
(<70% viable ASCs), lower quantities of B3 have increased 
the viability in comparison to AG hydrogels without B3 
after 7 days in culture (>80% viable ASCs).
 sntsplit:
In the first place, 10 mg of PI was dissolved in 1 mL of 0.1M

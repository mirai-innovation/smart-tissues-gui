HHSs were subject to a static condition without mechanical stimu- lation within 4 s in cell suspension (1 × 106cells/mL), or a cycle of compression- recovery within 4 s at 80% strain in hBMSCs cell suspension (1 × 106cells/mL) under a dynamic condition.

Firstly, two approaches were used: The ﬁrst one was direct immersion of HHSs in hBMSCs cell suspension (1 × 106cells/mL) for 4 s under a static condition; while the second one utilized acompression-recovery cycle in hBMSCs cell suspension under 80% strain within 4 s ( V 1-mechanical response).
 sntsplit:
The number of cells loaded into HHSs were quanti ﬁed by ImageJ. Subsequently, the in ﬂuence of compression displacement (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) in hBMSCs cell suspension (1 × 10 6cells/mL) and cycle times (1, 3, 5, and 10) under 40% compression displacementin hBMSCs cell suspension (5 × 10 5cells/mL) on cell loading of HHSs were also evaluated respectively.

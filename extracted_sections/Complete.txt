 sntsplit:
Firstly, two approaches were used: The ﬁrst one was direct immersion of HHSs in hBMSCs cell suspension (1 × 106cells/mL) for 4 s under a static condition; while the second one utilized acompression-recovery cycle in hBMSCs cell suspension under 80% strain within 4 s ( V 1-mechanical response).
 sntsplit:
The number of cells loaded into HHSs were quanti ﬁed by ImageJ. Subsequently, the in ﬂuence of compression displacement (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) in hBMSCs cell suspension (1 × 10 6cells/mL) and cycle times (1, 3, 5, and 10) under 40% compression displacementin hBMSCs cell suspension (5 × 10 5cells/mL) on cell loading of HHSs were also evaluated respectively.
 sntsplit:
After the scaffolds were incubated in the cell incubator for 30 min, the cell suspension (1 mL, 1 106cells/mL) was added on each scaffold and incubated at 37C in 5% CO 2.
 sntsplit:
The cell density in bio-inks was 1 107cells/mL. In order to improve the biological activity of the scaffold, BMP-2 and PDGF were added into the bio-inks with a ﬁnal concentration of 5 ug/mL and 100 ng/mL, respectively.

Preparation of cell-laden bioink To prepare the cell-laden bioink, 20 mg/mL alginate and 30 mg/mL PEO (A2P3) were dissolved in triple-distilled water and magnetically stirred for 2 days at 4/C14C. Then, 1 /C2107cells/mL MSCs or SMCs were added to the A2P3 solution.
 sntsplit:
The bioink was prepared by mixing a 2% alginate and 3% PEO (A2P3) solution with MSCs and SMCs at 1 /C2107cells/mL. Alginate is a biocompatible, non-toxic, and versatile polymer that enables rapid gelation of the microstructure through the addition of cations [ 40].

RFP-HUVECs were either suspended alone or with hADSCs at a 2:1 ratio for a total cell  density of 5 million cells/mL in each alginate solution.

HUVECs and hADSCs were stained with Calcein-AM before  being suspended 2:1 in partially crosslinked alginate at a total density of 3 million cells/mL  and pipetted into the glass tips.

To fabricate a heterogenous VTU,  RFP-HUVECs and hADSCs were suspended in the vasculogenic bioink in a 2:1 ratio (RFP- HUVEC:ADSC) at a total cell density of 5 million cells/mL. To fabricate a mixed VTU,  RFP-HUVECs, hADSCs, and GFP-hDFs were suspended in the vasculogenic bioink in a  2:1:1 ratio (RFP-HUVEC:ADSC:GFP-hDF) at a total cell density of 5 million cells/mL. For  both heterogenous and mixed VTUs, GFP-hDFs were loaded at a density of 2 million  cells/mL in the fibroblast-containing bioink.

For instance, among collagen constructs seeded with  6 × 105, 3 × 106, 3 × 107, and 1 × 108 cells/mL, a scaffold with cell density above 3  × 106 cells/mL revealed a significant decrease in break force when tensile testing was  performed immediately after compression at Day 10 [ 52].

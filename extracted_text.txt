Abstract
Bioprinting research is focused on utilizing growth factors and multiple cell types 
to create clinically relevant three-dimensional (3D) tissue models using hydrogels. 
Rheological and biological challenges are two main factors that limit the creation 
of extrudable bioactive hydrogels. In this study, we investigate incorporation of fast 
dissolving and bioactive borate glass in different weight to volume percentages 
(0.075 to 0.6%) to alginate-gelatin (1:1) hydrogel to improve rheological properties 
and enable bioprinting with bioactive glass. The addition of glass improved the 
stiffness of the hydrogel. Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) 
were uniformly mixed in this bioink at 1 × 106 cells/mL concentration, and spheroid 
specimens were cultured in both static and dynamic culture conditions. Grid-
shaped scaffolds measuring ~18 × 18 × 1 mm3 were fabricated with the viable glass 
concentrations, and ASC viability was evaluated using Live/Dead assay. Despite 
immediate toxicity, an increased viability after 7 days with 0.15 w/v % or less borate 
glass content demonstrated the potential in utilizing highly resorbable calcium-
releasing biomaterials such as bioactive glasses to modify hydrogels suitable for 
bioprinting cellularized 3D structures.

1. Introduction
Extrusion-based bioprinting is gaining in popularity because its versatility enables 
the fabrication of materials over a wide range of viscosities.1 A majority of the current 
generation commercial bioprinters are all based on extrusion three-dimensional (3D) 
printing techniques.2 The success of extrusion-based bioprinting depends largely on 
the proper selection of an extrudable hydrogel precursor and the proper selection of 
cell type. Hydrogels such as alginate, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, gelatin, collagen, fibrin, 
Matrigel, Pluronic® F127, and polyethylene glycol are commonly used to encapsulate

cells for extrusion-based bioprinting techniques.3 No one 
material offers both the required rheological and biological 
properties, and therefore, it is a common practice to create a 
composite hydrogel to suit specific bioprinting application.
Alginate has been extensively used as synthetic 
extracellular matrix (ECM) that mimics native human 
tissues for more than three decades.4,5 Alginate is derived 
from algae that crosslinks in the presence of divalent 
cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ and is suitable for bioprinting 
applications.6 As alginate exhibits poor cell adhesion and 
proliferation due to the lack of arginine-glycine-aspartate 
(RGD) tripeptide sequences, it is functionalized to include 
RGD peptide sequence in its molecular structure.7,8 An 
alternative approach is to add gelatin to alginate to prepare 
a composite hydrogel to enhance the hydrogel’s ability 
to support cell adhesion and rheological properties for 
extrusion-based bioprinting techniques.9-14 Despite being 
unstable at physiological temperatures, gelatin improves 
the printability of the composite alginate+gelatin (AG) 
hydrogel at room temperature due to the thermoreversible 
gel–sol transition behavior of gelatin.9 AG hydrogels have 
been evaluated by researchers in different weight ratios to 
improve rheological properties at room temperature to 
facilitate printability without affecting the cell viability.10,14 
Researchers have also pursued media ionic strength 
modification and deposition at ~10°C, instead of room 
temperature, to improve printability.13 Despite good 
viability (~90%) with epidermal stem cells, sheep stem 
cells, and aortic smooth muscle cells in the above studies, 
the main challenges that remain for AG hydrogel are to 
achieve: (i) printability at room temperature, (ii) controlled 
degradation of alginate, and (iii) slower dissolution of 
gelatin for improved viability over time. 
Until the late 2000s, a material was considered 
bioactive upon formation of a hydroxyapatite-like layer 
on its surface to bond with hard tissue (bone) upon 
implantation.15,16 Recently, the definition of “bioactive” 
has expanded, and the bioactive glass dissolution products 
have been increasingly investigated for vascularization, 
wound healing, cardiac, lung, and nerve tissue engineering 
applications in addition to traditional bone repair and 
teeth applications.17 The research on bioactive glasses has 
evolved to produce glass compositions that are highly 
resorbable based on borate (B2O3) network instead of 
traditional silicate (SiO2) network.18-20 The dissolution of 
bioactive glasses depends not only on the durability of the 
main glass-forming network (e.g., SiO2 or B2O3) and the 
overall glass composition, but it also depends on several 
other factors such as residual stresses during heat treatment 
and surface roughness.21 It is known that borate glass 
dissolves at a faster rate compared to Bioglass®, and the 
calcium (Ca2+) ions released during glass dissolution could 
initiate the crosslinking of alginate-based hydrogels.22 
Recently, investigators added copper or niobium to 
bioactive glass and then printed with hydrogel in order 
to fabricate a fast-recovering and printable construct.23,24 
Other researchers used borate-based bioactive glass to 
improve the printability of AG hydrogels by increasing the 
stiffness of the printed construct.25 
Previously, we investigated cell viability in a 
3D-bioprinted AG-glass composite hydrogel, using a 
recently FDA-approved borate-based bioactive glass (13-
93B3 glass, referred to as B3) and human adipose stem 
cells (ASCs).26 The B3 glass is particularly attractive due 
to its high dissolution rate and angiogenic ability.27-29 This 
specific glass composition has demonstrated an ability to 
heal difficult-to-treat diabetic wounds, a capability thought 
to stem from their angiogenic properties. However, the 
exact reasons for their effectiveness and the underlying 
mechanisms involved are still not entirely clear. One recent 
study showed that an increased collagen III/collagen I 
ratio for ASCs with B3 glass exposure could establish one 
possible mechanism for wound-healing behavior with B3 
glass.30 
ASCs are extracted from the stromal vascular fraction 
of subcutaneous fat, which is more accessible and 
involving a less invasive procedure than acquiring their 
bone marrow counterpart, the more commonly studied 
bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells.31-33 Additionally, 
they yield a greater number of cells after isolation than 
bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells and have a higher 
proliferative capacity. For these reasons, in addition to 
their differentiation, angiogenic, and therapeutic abilities, 
they are increasingly used in tissue engineering strategies. 
 
 
In this study, we: (i) examined how the rheological 
characteristics of AG hydrogel are enhanced by adding B3 
microparticles, (ii) identified the optimal range of B3 glass 
in bioprinting AG hydrogels and ASC viability, and (iii) 
evaluated the stability of AG hydrogel and the dissolution 
of gelatin under these conditions. 
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture
Frozen vials of human ASCs were thawed and plated in 
complete cell culture media (CCM) and incubated at 37°C 
with 5% humidified CO2. To ensure that the findings were 
universal and not unique to a single donor, ASCs from 
three different unrelated donors (LaCell, New Orleans, LA, 
USA) were tested in all experiments. More details about 
the ASC culture conditions and media requirements can 
be found in our previous work.34,35 CCM was prepared 
with alpha minimum essential media (α-MEM) by adding 
10% fetal bovine serum, 1% 100× L-glutamine, and

1% 100× antibiotic/antimycotic. On the second day of 
culture, ASCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS), viable ASCs were harvested with 0.25% trypsin/1 
mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and re-
plated at a concentration of no more than 15,000 ASCs 
per dish. ASCs that reached ≤70% confluency were lifted 
between the second and sixth passages for suspension in 
AG hydrogels for all experiments. ASCs from subsequent 
passages were not utilized for experiments as they could 
affect pluripotent properties of ASCs. 
2.2. Bioink preparation
Gelatin (Type B, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 
in 3 w/v % (0.3 g in 10 mL) was dissolved in Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, MA, USA) in a glass beaker at ~40°C while being 
magnetically stirred at 150 rpm. After gelatin dissolution, 
sodium alginate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 3 
w/v % (0.3 g in 10 mL) was added to the gelatin solution 
and mixed overnight to obtain the AG hydrogel. B3 glass 
powder particles (less than 20 µm with ~3 µm d50 particle 
size; chemical composition in wt.%: 53% B2O3, 20% CaO, 
12% K2O, 6% Na2O, 5% MgO, 4% P2O5) were added to the 
solution in four different weight ratios (0.075, 0.15, 0.3, and 
0.6 w/v %) after gelatin dissolution and allowed to dissolve 
for ~10 min before the addition of alginate powder. For 
example, 0.075 w/v % B3 glass corresponds to 1.25% 
of total combined weight of alginate and gelatin in the 
solution. Therefore, AG hydrogels made with 0.075, 0.15, 
0.3, and 0.6 w/v % B3 glass are referred as 1.25G, 2.5G, 5G, 
and 10G, respectively, in this paper. All powders including 
gelatin, sodium alginate, and B3 glass powder particles were 
ultraviolet-sterilized before being added to the DMEM 
solution. ASCs pellet (4 × 106) was re-suspended in 0.2 
mL CCM and pipetted into AG hydrogel and magnetically 
stirred for no more than 3 min to obtain a uniform cell 
distribution and a final ASC concentration of 1.0 × 106 cells 
per 1 mL of bioink. The bioink was transferred to 3 mL 
Loctite® Henkel syringe barrel, centrifuged to remove air 
bubbles, and attached with 22G (410 µm) or 25G (250 µm) 
tips (SmoothFlow Tapered, Nordson EFD, Westlake, OH, 
USA) for 3D bioprinting.
2.3. Rheological characterization
For rheological characterization, hydrogels were prepared 
in deionized (DI) water with gelatin (3 w/v %), alginate 
(3 w/v %), and AG (6 w/v %), and with the addition of 
B3 glass in different weight concentrations. AG hydrogels 
with and without B3 glass were tested for viscosity using 
a Kinexus rheometer (Malvern Panalytical, Westborough, 
MA, USA) with a parallel plate set-up. A gap of 0.5 mm was 
set between plates, and the measurements were conducted 
at room temperature. A fresh scoop of gel was loaded each 
time to test viscosity, recovery, yield strength, etc. Three 
different tests were conducted on the gels: (i) viscosity 
vs. shear rate (to measure viscosity with increasing shear 
rate from 0.1 to 100 s-1), (ii) oscillation amplitude sweep, 
and (iii) recovery tests (changing shear rate from steady 
state to a predetermined rate for a certain amount of 
time). In oscillation amplitude sweeps, percentage strain 
was considered input, and machine output data of loss vs. 
storage modulus components were plotted. Data points 
below 0.1 s-1 shear rate were not reported because of the 
instability at low shear rates. Although one set of data was 
reported for each gel type, measurements were repeated 
to confirm the validity of the data. Statistical analysis of 
the rheological data was not performed because of the 
significant differences between the samples prepared with 
several orders of magnitudes difference in results.
2.4. Scaffold fabrication
A custom-modified tabletop cartesian 3D printer to 
include syringes connected through digital syringe 
dispenser (Loctite®, Rocky Hill, CT, USA) was used to 
fabricate scaffolds. The 3D printer and printing schema 
are illustrated in Figure 1a and b, and the 3D printer is 
shown in Figure 1c. Scaffold dimensions were set to 15 
mm length, 15 mm width, and ~ 1 mm thickness (6 layers) 
and printed with 0–90° filament orientation in alternate 
layers. A customized software was written for G-code 
generation and syringe dispenser control. Sterile practices 
were followed for scaffold fabrication with ASCs, bioink 
syringes were maintained at room temperature, and the 
scaffolds were bioprinted in less than an hour inside the 
laminar flow hood.
2.5. Physical assessment
Test specimens with overall dimensions of 40 × 20 × 5 
mm3 were fabricated to have a 20 mm gauge length and 
10 mm section width for tensile tests. Dense specimens 
without any designed pores were used for these tests, and 
specimens were crosslinked with 0.1 M CaCl2 solution 
for 10 min before tensile tests. Specimens were tested on 
Instron machine (Instron 5969, Norwood, MA, USA) at a 
crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The swelling properties of 
the hydrogel were assessed on scaffolds with dimensions 
of 15 × 15 × 1 mm3. Swelling percentage (S) was calculated 
using the formula, S = [(St – Sc)/S] × 100, where St is scaffold 
weight after 24 h soak in DI water, and Sc is scaffold weight 
immediately after crosslinking. 
2.6. Scanning electron microscopy
Hydrogel in bulk (~2–3 mL in a centrifuge tube) was freeze-
dried to porous foam-like pellets. The pellets were coated 
with Au-Pd for about ~60 s by mounting the samples on 
a rotating platform using a Hummer Sputter Coater. The

samples were observed under a field emission scanning 
electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-4700, Hitachi, Japan) to 
analyze the microstructure by capturing the images at 5 kV 
accelerating voltage at various magnifications. 
2.7. X-ray diffraction analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Philips X-Pert, 
Westborough, MA, USA) was performed on the 
powdered freeze-dried sample to test for any crystalline 
hydroxyapatite-like formations in the material. Scans were 
run from 2θ values ranging from 10° to 80° using Cu Kα 
radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm).
2.8. 1H-NMR spectroscopy analysis
In this work, gelatin was physically blended with alginate to 
form a composite gel and not chemically crosslinked. It was 
expected that with time as bioprinted scaffold is incubated 
at 37°C, gelatin present in the scaffold could potentially be 
separated and leached into the media. In order to study the 
release of gelatin from the AG hydrogel used in this study, 
AG, 1.25G, and 2.5G scaffolds measuring 15 × 15 × 1 mm3 
were fabricated without cells, crosslinked with 0.1 M CaCl2 
solution for 10 min, and washed twice with DI water. The 
samples were soaked in DI water in airtight containers 
under standard culture conditions for up to 7 days. The 
surrounding DI water collected after 1 day and 7 days 
including the CaCl2 solution used for crosslinking were 
all analyzed for presence of gelatin using proton nuclear 
magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker 400 
MHz Avance™ III HD, Billerica, MA, USA). First, known 
quantities of gelatin were dissolved in DI water, and 0.2 mL 
of gelatin solution was mixed with 0.6 mL of deuterium 
oxide (99.9 atom %, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 
and the solution was transferred to NMR tube (Colorspec®, 
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and analyzed for 10 
min. The area under a unique characteristic gelatin peak at 
~1.9 ppm (Figure 2a) on the horizontal axis was calculated

and averaged for known quantity of gelatin concentration 
to obtain a gelatin standard curve as shown in Figure 2b. 
2.9. Cell viability
The ASC viability was evaluated using a Live/Dead 
viability kit (ref. L3224, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, 20 
µL of ethidium homodimer-1 and 5 µL of calcein were 
pipetted into 10 mL of PBS to create the Live/Dead 
reagent. At specific time points, scaffolds were washed 
twice with PBS and soaked in 1 mL of reagent solution for 
at least 30 min under dark conditions at room temperature 
before imaging under a confocal microscope (Nikon 
A1R-HD Eclipse Ti2, Melville, NY, USA). A random 5 × 
5 mm2 area was imaged with a 40 µm step for each of the 
three scaffolds at different time points. To quantify the 
viability results, a maximum intensity projection image 
was created with red, green, and blue channels using 
ImageJ software. The red and green channels of the image 
provided the dead cell and live cell counts. ASC viability 
in percentage was calculated using this formula: [live 
cells/(live cells + dead cells)] × 100%.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Six samples in each set were used for tensile tests, and 
three samples in each set were used for cell viability 
quantification. The results were reported as average ± 
standard deviation. Minitab® software was used to analyze 
the difference in means of different groups using one-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA). The means were considered 
significantly different if the P-value is less than 0.05.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Rheological assessment of hydrogels
One of the objectives of the study was to evaluate the 
extent of rheological modification of the AG hydrogel 
with the addition of B3 glass. Hydrogel viscosity and its 
shear-thinning behavior are crucial in extrusion-based 3D 
printing processes as such behavior allows the material to 
flow through the nozzle at low air pressure without causing 
severe damage to cells. DI water was used to investigate 
the rheological behavior of B3 glass-mixed gels instead of 
complete culture media. The reason for this choice is to 
analyze the true nature of the effect of the dissolved glass 
and released ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, and others from the glass) 
without having any interactions with other salts present 
in the culture media. It was hypothesized that the effect 
of B3 glass amount on rheological behavior would serve 
as a realistic indicator while using gels made with culture 
media. Despite the evidence in literature demonstrating a 
significant difference in the swelling of gels made with DI 
water compared to that of gels made with culture media, 
the difference is insignificant for viscosity of gels made 
with DI water or culture media with highly resorbable 
B3 glass.36 It was noticed in our experiments that B3 glass 
dissolves in a few minutes during the gel mixing process to 
significantly affect gel viscosity irrespective of the media 
(DI water or culture media). Figure 3 shows the change 
in viscosity of all hydrogels considered in this study with 
increasing shear rate. The viscosity of alginate (Alg),

gelatin (Gel), and alginate+gelatin (Alg+Gel or AG) is 
shown in Figure 3a, and the viscosity of B3 glass-modified 
AG hydrogels with 1.25 wt.% (1.25G), 2.5 wt.% (2.5G), 5 
wt.% (5G), and 10 wt.% (10G) glass content is shown in 
Figure 3b. The viscosity for all hydrogels was measured 
at room temperature and before crosslinking with 0.1 M 
CaCl2 solution. At higher shear rates, modified hydrogels 
with B3 glass slipped out of the plates (especially, 5G and 
10G) of the rheometer, and the test was stopped before the 
programmed shear rate of 100 s-1. Overall, all AG hydrogels 
irrespective of B3 glass addition showed a shear-thinning 
behavior with decreased viscosity at increasing shear rates. 
As B3 glass is a fast-dissolving bioactive glass, it quickly 
starts to release Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, which are divalent, 
and other ions including K+, PO4
3-, Na+, and B3+ to the 
surrounding aqueous media. As the divalent ions initiate 
the crosslinking with alginate in the hydrogel, the viscosity 
of hydrogels with B3 glass was significantly increased by 
several orders of magnitude (Figure 3b). The addition of 2.5 
wt.% B3 glass resulted in a significant and sharp increase 
in hydrogel viscosity from 1.25 wt.% B3 glass addition 
(from ~350 Pa·s to ~7000 Pa·s at 100 s-1). The differences in 
viscosity at t = 0 s observed for 2.5G, 5G, and 10G hydrogels 
(~7000 Pa·s, ~10,000 Pa·s, and ~11,000 Pa·s at 100 s-1, 
respectively) were not as significant as viscosity differences 
between 1.25G and 2.5G hydrogels. These findings suggest 
the likelihood of an optimal B3 glass concentration, ranging 
between 1.25 and 2.5 wt.%, for AG hydrogels composed of 3 
w/v % alginate and 3 w/v % gelatin. 
Amplitude sweep oscillatory tests were conducted 
on all samples to determine the viscoelastic behavior 
of AG hydrogels modified with B3 glass. Figure 4 shows 
the variation of G’ and G’’ with strain percentage and 
the linear viscoelastic region for each hydrogel. At low 
concentrations of glass (1.25%), there is no significant 
difference in the storage modulus (G’) in comparison to 
AG hydrogel (Figure 4b), whereas with the increase in 
glass concentration to 2.5% made a significant difference. 
Figure 4c shows the variation in loss modulus (G’’) for all 
gels investigated in this study. The transition from G’’>G’ 
to G’>G’’ was more prominent in 2.5G, 5G (shown in 
Figure 4d and e), and 10G hydrogels clearly showing a 
viscoelastic solid-like behavior with a consistent behavior 
of G’>G’’
, indicating the increased stiffness of the modified 
AG hydrogels with B3 glass. This is observed with a clearly 
defined yield point (cross-over point of G’ and G’’). The 
shear stress values around the yield point for gels were 
recorded as ~3400 Pa for 2.5G, ~3000 Pa for 5G, and ~1300 
Pa for 10G. It is also observed that the yield point occurs 
at lower strain for gels made with higher glass percentage. 
This seems to be consistent with the lower shear stress 
values. This could be because of the non-uniformity of the 
composite AG gels made with higher glass percentages. 
Figure 4a shows the physical behavior of gels prepared 
with increasing glass content. It can be clearly seen that 
gel made with the most glass content behaves like a large 
piece of crosslinked gel. For example, extruding or manual 
separation of 10G gel resulted in pockets of crosslinked 
gel (pockets of gel chunks) being extruded or separated 
from the hydrogel rather than a single continuous filament 
extrusion. This non-uniformity is believed to arise during 
the gel preparation process as pockets of alginate could 
be crosslinked in a localized manner even before the 
complete uniform mixing of hydrogel. As a result, during 
the oscillatory sweep tests, chunks of gels were noticed to 
break apart and come out of the plates at higher strain. 
In addition to shear-thinning and solid-like behavior 
of hydrogels, the viscosity recovery of the hydrogel after 
removal of shear force is crucial in extrusion-based 3D 
bioprinting applications. As hydrogel is extruded through 
the nozzle, it suffers from higher shear stress and flows 
through the tip because of a shear-thinning behavior. After 
deposition of a filament, the hydrogel should recover its 
molecular structure and viscosity to avoid spreading on the 
substrate and withstand the weight of successive filaments 
that would be deposited on top of the current filament. 
To determine the recovery behavior of B3 glass-modified 
AG hydrogels in a rheometer, hydrogels were initially 
maintained under a steady-state shear rate of 0.1 s-1 to 
obtain a stabilized viscosity value. After reaching a steady-
state viscosity, the shear rate was increased to higher shear 
rates (10 s-1 and 100 s-1) in two separate tests for a specific 
amount of time (30 s and 10 s, respectively), immediately 
followed by a cooling period of 0.1 s-1 shear rate. Viscosity 
of hydrogels recorded at different shear rates with time is 
shown in Figure 5. The recovery data of two tests (at 10 s-1 
and at 100 s-1 shear rates) were combined, and the time scale 
was adjusted for a simplified representation. A significant 
drop in viscosity for all hydrogels at increased shear rates 
can be clearly observed in Figure 5. Recovery time is defined 
as the time taken for a hydrogel to attain its original steady-
state viscosity value from the reduced values at higher 
shear rates. The shear rate of 100 s-1 was used to mimic 
the behavior of the hydrogel passing through the nozzle 
tip during extrusion. The results indicated a “near-zero” 
recovery time for 2.5G and 5G hydrogels after application 
of 100 s-1 shear rate, which was evident from their step-
function-like recovery to attain a constant viscosity at 
160 s, as shown in Figure 5. 1.25G and AG hydrogels 
required 60 s and 90 s, respectively, to recover and attain a 
constant viscosity, as can be observed from the curvature 
indicated by arrows in Figure 5. It was also observed that 
hydrogels never truly recovered to 100% of their original 
steady-state viscosity values (at t = 0 s) after the removal

of 100 s-1 shear rate. For example, steady-state viscosity of 
2.5G hydrogel at t = 0 s was ~7000 Pa·s, and its recovered 
viscosity value between 160 and 220 s was at ~2000 Pa·s. 
This behavior was noticed in hydrogels with high B3 glass 
content (>2.5 wt.%) and believed to have occurred due to 
the loss of material between plates during tests at shear rate 
of 100 s-1. The recovery time results provided a satisfactory 
representation of the recovery behavior as they confirmed 
the printability of all hydrogels with and without B3 glass 
addition. The recovery behavior of 10G hydrogel is not 
shown in Figure 5 because of its inhomogeneity and high 
material loss during recovery tests even at low shear rates.
3.2. Fabrication, swelling, and mechanical 
property assessment
The determination of viscosity and material recovery 
times enabled scaffold fabrication with AG, 1.25G, and 
2.5G hydrogels. Six-layered scaffolds measuring 15 × 15 × 
1 mm3 were fabricated. The printing parameters used to 
fabricate scaffolds along with the printability matrix for 
different hydrogels are shown in Table 1. Hydrogels were 
first tested for their extrudability through a syringe at 
different air pressures with different nozzle tips. Although 
all hydrogel types were extrudable using different tip sizes 
ranging from internal diameter of 250 µm to 580 µm, 
the extrusion of highly viscous 5G and 10G hydrogels 
required high air pressures, extrudate was uneven, and 
consistent filament formation was not feasible. In part, this 
could be due to inhomogeneous mixture of alginate and 
gelatin components in 5G and 10G hydrogels. Addition of 
more glass meant availability of more Ca2+ ions to initiate 
alginate crosslinking before achieving a homogeneous 
composite hydrogel. Moreover, utilizing higher air 
pressures would damage the cells in the hydrogel, and large

tip sizes would compromise the resolution of the fabricated 
parts. Therefore, by considering the above, scaffolds were 
fabricated only with AG, 1.25G, and 2.5G hydrogels. Both 
22G (410 µm inner diameter) and 25G (250 µm inner 
diameter) conical-shaped nozzle tips were considered for 
printing the AG, 1.25G, and 2.5G hydrogels. Specifically, 
25G tips were used for AG and 1.25G gels, whereas 22G tip 
was used for 2.5G gels due to viscosity differences (orders 
of magnitude different). Despite using a larger tip, the 
air pressure required to extrude 2.5G gel was four times 
that of 1.25G, and the extrudate was thinner than that of 
1.25G gel. Therefore, the layer height had to be reduced 
to 0.12 mm from 0.14 mm for AG and 1.25G gels. For AG 
and 1.25 gels, the extrudate requires time to recover, and 
therefore despite using a smaller nozzle tip (25G–250 µm), 
the extrudate spreads immediately after printing and a ~1 
mm extrudate was obtained. This spreading behavior is 
expected based on the viscosity and poor recovery of the 
AG and 1.25 gels as discussed in our rheological study. A 
similar sized extrudate (~1 mm) width was obtained for 
2.5G gel printed with a larger tip (22G–410 µm) and a 
much higher air pressure. The recovery time determined 
by recovery tests was implemented as dwell (wait) time 
between successive layers during scaffold fabrication. 
Figure 6 shows scaffolds fabricated before and after dwell 
time implementation. Before dwell time implementation, 
fabrication of a designed porous scaffold resulted in solid 
part formation after six layers of deposition as shown in 
Figure 6. This happened as the initially deposited layers 
merged on the substrate unable to recover and carry the 
weight of successive layers that were deposited during part 
fabrication. However, dwell time implementation allowed 
Figure 5. Effect of B3 glass addition on the recovery behavior of hydrogels. AG hydrogel and 1.25G required 90 s and 60 s, respectively, to recover to their 
original viscosity values, whereas 2.5G and 5G show immediate recovery.

the filament recovery and thus enabled the designed 
scaffold fabrication. This was further tested in a complex 
3D structure with internal channels mimicking a vascular 
network (Figure 7).   
Scaffolds were crosslinked with 0.1 M CaCl2 solution 
for 10 min immediately after fabrication, washed, and 
soaked in DI water for 24 h to measure the swelling 
percentage. Swelling of hydrogels indirectly represents 
the capacity of the material to absorb media and allow 
cell growth and proliferation. Swelling of AG hydrogel 
was increased after 24 h with the addition of B3 glass. The 
swelling of AG scaffolds was ~36%, whereas it increased 
to ~44% for 1.25G scaffolds and further to ~51% for 2.5G 
scaffolds. The release of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions with B3 glass 
dissolution initiates alginate crosslinking during hydrogel 
preparation (overnight stirring), and the molecular 
structure was further condensed after crosslinking with 
CaCl2 solution. Therefore, 2.5G scaffolds have a highly 
defined and consolidated molecular structure among the 
three scaffolds, and this was evident from the shrinkage 
of 2.5G scaffolds (~18%) after crosslinking. After scaffolds 
were soaked in DI water, they relaxed and absorbed DI 
water driven by the ionic concentration gradient with 
high number of ions present inside the scaffold structure 
(because of glass dissolution), and no ions present in the 
soaked media (DI water). Hydrogel swelling depends on 
the ionic concentration of the soaking solution and the 
number of ionic groups present in the hydrogel. It was 
reported that increased ionic groups in hydrogel increased 
its swelling ratio because of the osmotic pressure created 
by the increased counterions in the hydrogel.37 This could 
be the reason for the high swelling percentage observed 
for 2.5G scaffolds. Higher swelling ratio for AG hydrogels 
prepared with high ionic strength PBS was also reported in 
a recent work and was consistent with our results.13 
In this study, small amounts of B3 glass (7.5 mg/10 
mL of DI water for 1.25G and 15 mg/10 mL of DI water

aided in hydrogel recovery and made it feasible to fabricate AG and 1.25G scaffolds. Increasing the B3 glass content reduced the dwell time from 90 s to 
0 s as 2.5G hydrogel scaffold could be fabricated with no dwell time. Failure to fabricate parts (dog-bone like specimen) with 5G hydrogel is also shown.

for 2.5G) were added to modify the AG hydrogel. The 
dissolution rate of borate-based glasses including B3 
glass in different forms such as glass microspheres, large 
particles (>200 µm), and scaffolds in DI water, PBS, and 
simulated body fluid (SBF) have been investigated in the 
past.38-41 These studies reported that the majority of B3 
glass dissolution occurred during the first 24-h soak period 
after which the dissolution rate slowed due to the ionic 
concentration gradient and other factors. In comparison, 
the glass particles used in the current study are significantly 
smaller with an average particle size of 3 µm (20 µm mesh 
sieved) that could have dissolved within 24 h. Therefore, 
it could be safely assumed that the rheological, swelling, 
and mechanical properties of the modified AG hydrogels 
are mostly dependent on the ionic dissolution products of 
B3 glass and not the physical presence of glass particulates. 
Figure 8a shows the microstructure of the 2.5G hydrogel, 
indicating a highly porous and honeycomb-like structure 
with interconnected porosity. B3 glass particles were not 
detected in the microstructure, and the characteristic 
amorphous peaks of the glasses were also absent in the 
XRD analysis of the 2.5G hydrogel.
Figure 8b shows the dog-bone-shaped specimens 
utilized for evaluating the tensile strength of hydrogels 
immediately after crosslinking. A typical load vs. deflection 
curve for all three specimens is shown in Figure 8c, which 
indicates the increase in scaffold stiffness with the addition 
of B3 glass. The elastic modulus of AG, 1.25G, and 2.5G 
specimens was 33 ± 17 kPa, 62 ± 7 kPa, and 73 ± 13 kPa, 
respectively, and the ultimate tensile strength of specimens 
was 26 ± 5 kPa, 21 ± 4 kPa, and 34 ± 9 kPa. 2.5G specimens 
had highest ultimate tensile strength and were significantly 
stiffer (p < 0.05) in comparison to AG specimens. The 
increased stiffness was in agreement with the rheological 
data that showed increased viscosity, decreased recovery 
time, and a viscoelastic solid-like behavior for 2.5G 
hydrogels. As the added B3 glass dissolves, the dissolution 
ions crosslink more alginate polymer chains in the AG 
hydrogel that causes increased stiffness. Researchers have 
previously reported that human mesenchymal stem cells 
(MSCs) encapsulated in ionically crosslinked alginate 
hydrogels show adipogenic differentiation at moduli of 
<10 kPa and show osteogenic differentiation at moduli 
of 11–30 kPa.42,43 The authors also suggest that osteogenic 
differentiation of MSCs could be enhanced in hydrogels 
with faster stress relaxation. AG hydrogels modified with 
B3 glass (2.5G and 1.25G) have elastic moduli in similar 
range, and the stress relaxation occurs through breakage 
and subsequent forming of ionic crosslinks. In addition, 
stress relaxation could also occur because of the fast 
swelling of B3 glass modified AG hydrogels (especially, 
2.5G). Therefore, the addition of B3 glass to modify AG 
hydrogels could be useful to tune the human stem cells 
activity. 
An important factor to consider is the retention of 
scaffold mechanical properties (or scaffold integrity and 
structure) in culture conditions with time. AG hydrogel 
strength greatly depends on the w/v % of the alginate and 
gelatin used in the preparation and the ionic strength of 
the crosslinking solution. For example, Duan et al. used 6 
w/v % of alginate and gelatin (compared to 3 w/v % used 
in our study), and the crosslinked samples with 0.3 M 
CaCl2 (compared to 0.1 M CaCl2 in our study) reported 
improved mechanical properties that were able to sustain 
for up to 7 days in culture conditions.14 Our attempts to 
test specimens after soaking them in DMEM for 7 days 
at culture conditions were not successful as specimens 
were broken in the grips of the Instron machine, and 
insignificant elastic modulus and strength values were 
recorded. Our results indicated a rapid loss of modulus 
and strength to a point where they were not suitable for 
any load-bearing applications, which is in agreement with 
results reported by Giuseppe et al.10 However, it must be 
noted that 1.25G and 2.5G scaffolds had sufficient integrity

after 14 days in culture to handle and perform biological 
assays. In general, hydrogel degradation depends on the 
soaking media composition and enzymes present in it. In 
our study, DI water was utilized to prepare all hydrogels and 
to investigate the scaffold swelling characteristics, which 
are different from other studies where PBS or DMEM was 
utilized. Nevertheless, samples used for mechanical tests 
were stored in DMEM to mimic the in vitro environment. 
In addition, we also investigated the structural integrity of 
2.5G scaffolds in the CCM at culture conditions without 
crosslinking with CaCl2 solution. This test was performed 
to examine if the divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) that are 
released from B3 glass into the hydrogel, which helps initiate 
the hydrogel crosslinking, would be sufficient to sustain the 
scaffold structural integrity in culture conditions. Figure 9 
shows a collapsed 2.5G scaffold that was not crosslinked 
after a 2-h incubation in CCM at 37°C, whereas a scaffold 
crosslinked with 0.1 M CaCl2 retained its structural fidelity 
after 7 days in culture. This result demonstrates that despite 
the improvement achieved with B3 glass addition in terms 
of printability of AG hydrogel, rheological characteristics, 
and initial mechanical properties, addition of glass alone 
would not be sufficient to fabricate a 3D scaffold without 
the chemical crosslinking using CaCl2 solution.
3.3. Effect of B3 glass on ASCs viability
One important objective of this study was to evaluate the 
amount of B3 glass that is acceptable to add to the AG 
hydrogel to provide viable human ASCs. As B3 glass dissolves 
much faster than traditional silicate-based bioactive glasses 
and faster than 45S5 glass, it was important to establish that 
the resultant concentration of ionic dissolution products 
has no toxic effects on ASCs in vitro. The toxicity could 
be resulted due to pH increase as alkali ions are released 
to CCM with B3 glass dissolution. Recently, B3 glass was 
added to ASCs in two different approaches: directly being 
added as particles during cell culture, and indirectly (glass 
dissolution products) exposing cells to two-dimensional 
(2D) cell culture environment at a B3 glass concentrations 
that are less than 10 mg/mL.30,35 These studies reported 
that a high concentration of B3 glass exposure (>10 mg/
mL) could be toxic to ASCs, whereas low concentrations 
alter ASC protein secretions that may regulate wound 
healing. Several studies have investigated the toxicity of 
silicate-based bioactive glasses toward stem cells in a 2D 
environment, reporting that an optimum concentration 
of ionic dissolution products could exist upon which the 
treatment that could be toxic to cells was administered.44-46 
To establish a baseline, we first investigated the B3 glass 
toxicity to ASCs in 3D environment by adding glass in 
different weight percentages to AG hydrogel. First, ASCs 
were encapsulated in AG, 1.25G, 2.5G, 5G, and 10G 
hydrogels, and 3D-bioprinted as spheroids. To investigate 
the cell viability, spheroids were cultured in both static 
(6-well plates under standard culture conditions) and 
dynamic (6-well plates kept on a rocker) conditions. Figure 
10 shows the live/dead assay images of the spheroids on 
day 0 (2 to 4 h after extrusion and crosslinking), day 1, 
and day 4 after culture. Spheroids made with 5G and 10G 
spheroids were irregular in shape because of the high 
viscosity, and difficulties were encountered to uniformly 
mix ASCs in these hydrogels. Patches of the hydrogel with 
empty pockets (without cells) and irregular shapes could be 
observed in the live/dead images of 5G and 10G hydrogels 
(Figure 10d, e, i, and n). Also, significant number of dead 
cells (red spots) can be observed in the live/dead images of 
5G and 10G spheroids at all time points which was not the 
case with other spheroids, whereas more viable ASCs than 
dead cells were noticed in AG, 1.25G, and 2.5G spheroids.
Figure 11 shows the quantification of the live/dead 
assay results. The results clearly indicate that increasing 
the percentage of B3 glass could be toxic to ASCs in the 
hydrogel. The viability of ASCs in AG spheroids without 
B3 glass was significantly higher than ASC viability in 
10G, 5G, and 2.5G spheroids immediately after extrusion 
and crosslinking with CaCl2. ASC viability in spheroids 
cultured under dynamic conditions was also higher in 
comparison to viability in spheroids cultured under static 
conditions after 24 h. This could be due to efficient nutrient 
transfer to ASCs under dynamic conditions than static 
conditions. In addition, for spheroids containing B3 glass, 
Ca2+, B3+, and other ions released after glass dissolution in 
the spheroid could diffuse more freely to the media under 
dynamic conditions than static culture conditions. This 
could cause the pH of the spheroid to go basic in static 
conditions and negatively affect ASCs. Addition of B3 
glass increased the pH of hydrogels from neutral for AG to 
pH 8 for 1.25G, pH 8.5 for 2.5G, and up to pH 9 for 10G 
hydrogel. This could be the reason for high toxicity of B3 
glass to ASCs, especially in 2.5G, 5G, and 10G spheroids 
on day 0, i.e., immediately after mixing ASCs. Though the 
inside of spheroid maintained relatively high pH, the pH 
of the surrounding CCM remained neutral during culture

in hydrogel modified with lower glass percentages (p < 0.05).

conditions. This could be attributed to two reasons: (i) the 
increase in pH due to release of ions from B3 glass to a 
larger extent could be limited to inside of the hydrogel 
matrix, and (ii) the release of gelatin from hydrogel matrix 
to surrounding media could neutralize the increase in pH 
because of any ions released from B3 glass, thereby causing 
the pH of the media to remain in the neutral range (7–
7.6) for all gel types (1.25G to 10G). In any case, with the 
regular change in media and presence of dynamic culture 
conditions, pH of the spheroids and neutralized media 
as well as ASC viability eventually improved after 7 days 
in culture, and 2.5G spheroids had significantly higher 
viability than AG spheroids.
The ASC viability in spheroidal culture helped 
determine the range of viable B3 glass percentages that 
could be added to AG hydrogel (0.075 and 0.15 w/v % or 
1.25G and 2.5G gels) and the suitable culture conditions 
(dynamic better than static). Nonetheless, it is important to 
validate the established B3 glass concentrations and culture 
conditions with the 3D-printed constructs. Therefore, AG, 
1.25G and 2.5G lattice structures containing ASCs and 
measuring 15 × 15 × 1 mm3 were bioprinted and cultured 
for up to 7 days under dynamic conditions. Figure 12 
shows the live/dead assay images of the scaffolds. A higher 
percentage of viable ASCs (green spots) than dead cells 
can be clearly seen in all images. A higher percentage of 
dead cells in the edges of the pores, possibly caused by the 
crosslinking with CaCl2 solution, is a notable observation. 
Figure 13 shows the results of quantified live/dead assay 
images of bioprinted scaffolds. The ASC viability in 
scaffolds was similar to the viability of AG, 1.25G, and 
2.5G spheroids, with ASC viability in AG scaffold being 
significantly higher than 2.5G scaffold. However, after 7 
days in culture, despite possessing a higher percentage of 
viable ASC populations, both 1.25G and 2.5G scaffolds 
were not significantly different than AG scaffolds in terms 
of cell viability. In addition, a significant decline in ASC 
viability in AG hydrogel was observed in both bioprinted 
scaffolds and spheroids from day 1 to day 7 under culture 
conditions. The decline in ASC viability could be attributed 
to the release of gelatin from AG hydrogel scaffold. In 
this study, gelatin was mainly added for cell adhesion 
and proliferation as alginate alone does not contain the 
necessary RGD tripeptide to support cell adhesion. In AG

cells (red spots) were observed near pore edges in comparison with the scaffold interior, indicating cell death due to exposure to CaCl2 solution during 
crosslinking and the overall presence of low cell numbers at edges.

hydrogel preparation, gelatin and alginate hydrogels were 
physically blended together to form a composite hydrogel. 
In order to study the release of gelatin from the AG hydrogel 
used in this study, AG, 1.25G and 2.5G scaffolds measuring 
15 × 15 × 1 mm3 were fabricated without cells, crosslinked 
with CaCl2 solution, and soaked in DI water under standard 
culture conditions for up to 7 days. The surrounding DI 
water was collected after 24 h and on day 7 and checked for 
gelatin presence using proton nuclear magnetic resonance 
(1H-NMR) spectroscopy (Figure 2). The results indicated 
that gelatin release started immediately after crosslinking 
and continued as scaffolds incubated in DI water (Figure 
14). This loss of ~70% of gelatin from the scaffold could 
possibly explain the decline in ASC viability after 7 days in 
culture in AG scaffolds. The release of gelatin from 1.25G 
and 2.5G scaffolds was ~40% and ~50%, respectively, which 
could explain the modest improvement in cell viability 
in these scaffolds in comparison to AG scaffolds after 7 
days. A more appropriate possibility in future could be 
to covalently crosslink the gelatin and alginate molecular 
chains for prolonged culture conditions and slow down the 
release of gelatin from the structure (limited to no more 
than ~25% after 7 days) as proposed in one study.47
Studies

investigated 
the 
hydrogel+bioactive glass composite focused on creating 
a 3D porous matrix or scaffolds for cell seeding and 
injectable matrix for bone repair, as well as applications 
mostly limited to bone tissue engineering.48-54 To date, very 
few studies have investigated the addition of bioactive glass 
to hydrogel to regulate hydrogel viscosity and incorporate 
cells in the hydrogel+bioactive glass matrix for bioprinting 
tissue models or 3D cell culture applications.55-58 Addition 
of silicate-based bioactive glass nanoparticles to alginate 
dialdehyde-gelatin promoted bone-like apatite layer 
formation and showed no toxicity to the bioprinted human 
osteosarcoma cells (MG-63).55 Results from experimenting 
with human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) encapsulated 
in a bioactive glass containing alginate/Matrigel composite 
hydrogel indicated higher levels of osteogenic expression 
by DPSCs in the presence of both Matrigel and bioactive 
glass.57 Although bioactive glass composition was not 
reported in the aforementioned study, the minimal effects 
on mechanical properties of composite hydrogels could 
perhaps indicate a slow dissolving silicate-based bioactive 
glass. In another study, ionic dissolution products of a 
silicate-based bioactive glass were used to prepare an 
osteogenic media to culture and crosslink gellan gum or 
collagen type I hydrogels containing ASCs. Another study 
reported osteogenesis of ASCs in hydrogels modified 
with bioactive glass.58 One common aspect in the above 
studies is the use of silicate-based bioactive glass. The 
dissolution rates of silicate-based glasses are several times 
slower in comparison to borate-based glasses.15 Therefore, 
nanoparticles of silicate-based glass are often used to fasten

with the addition of 2.5 wt.% borate glass content in bioprinted scaffolds in less than 4 h after glass addition. After 7 days in culture, ASCs, which were 
recovered in modified hydrogels, exhibited higher cell viability in scaffolds bioprinted with modified hydrogels in comparison with AG hydrogel, although 
the difference was not statistically significant (p < 0.05).

the glass particle dissolution and release ions to control 
the hydrogel viscosity and establish a window of printable 
time for the composite hydrogel.55 However, borate-based 
bioactive glasses dissolve rapidly and supply the dissolution 
products (including Ca2+ ions) to control the hydrogels 
viscosity for 3D printing without affecting their shear-
thinning behavior. The mechanisms that are currently 
adopted during bioprinting with alginate-based hydrogels 
include filament exposure to CaCl2 solution to initiate 
crosslinking and fabrication under temperature-controlled 
environment by modifying the solvent ionic strength.13,59 In 
this study, we successfully demonstrated bioprinting with 
borate glass-modified hydrogels at room temperature. This 
study is the first to report the use of borate-based bioactive 
glass to improve the extrudability of alginate-based 
hydrogels with consideration of human ASC viability.
4. Conclusion
Our research showcased the capability of B3 glass to 
facilitate printing using AG hydrogel at room temperature, 
eliminating the requirement for a temperature-controlled 
setting. This improvement was analyzed not just in terms 
of the hydrogel’s printability at room temperature, but 
also regarding its impact on cell viability. Rheological 
properties of an AG hydrogel were modified with the 
addition of 0.075 to 0.6 w/v % of highly resorbable B3 glass, 
and scaffolds were successfully fabricated. The addition of 
B3 glass (0.075 and 0.15 w/v %) increased the viscosity 
(from 0.2 kPa·s to 7 kPa·s) and made the AG hydrogel 
exhibit a viscoelastic solid-like behavior (G’> G’’) that 
improved the hydrogel recovery and enabled effortless 
extrusion 3D printing of scaffolds. AG scaffold stiffness 
increased with the addition of B3 (from 33 kPa to 73 kPa), 
and the mechanical properties showed the potential of 
the modified AG hydrogel to serve as a viable matrix for 
human ASCs. Despite the toxicity of B3 to ASCs when 
added in quantities higher than 0.3 w/v % to hydrogel 
(<70% viable ASCs), lower quantities of B3 have increased 
the viability in comparison to AG hydrogels without B3 
after 7 days in culture (>80% viable ASCs). Overall, the 
rheological modification of alginate-based hydrogels with 
B3 glass showed the potential for future applications in 
extrusion-based bioprinting with human ASCs.
